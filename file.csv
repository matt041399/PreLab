a = 400
s = '0.%02sem' % str(a)[:-1]

print(s)  # actual outcome  // 0.40em
print('0.40em')  # expected outcome  / 0.40em

s = '0.%02sem' % str(a)[:-1]

print(s)  # actual outcome  /  0. 8em
print('0.08em')  # expected outcome  /  0.08em```
So in short, if a is 2 digits or 3 digits it'd format differently"
2,1546253351.727,Raven,"It seems to me that this should be a numerical conversion, rather than converting it to a string and picking individual characters out.; Leading zeros is something you apply to numbers rather than to strings. You're lucky that the first example works because it doesn't need any leading zeros."
2,1546253511.7283,Rubie,"Okay I'll rethink this one :slightly_smiling_face:; This seems to work, is this the best way to do it do you think ```# Example 1
a = int(str(400)[:-1])
s = f""0.{a:02}em""

print(s)  # actual outcome  /  0.40em
print('0.40em')  # expected outcome  /  0.40em

print('0.08em')  # expected outcome  /  0.08em```"
2,1546254012.7289,Raven,"no; If you're just trying to show numbers that have decreased by some amount, there is no need to convert them to strings and extract substrings"
2,1546254058.73,Rubie,I do need to remove the last digit
2,1546254085.7305,Raven,"To change 400 to 0.4, you divide by 1000. If you then want to format 0.4 as 0.40, that is something you do in the string formatting stage; ```

'0.40'

The function above works as intended outside my class; How do I access the same function and when placed inside my class?; What I want is to write a print statement outside my class. I tried this one with no success `print(Skye.address_lookup('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx'))`; The traceback I get is ```TypeError: address_lookup() missing 1 required positional argument: 'address'```"

4,1546339557.7516,Conchita,"Ok, so first I need to create an instance like ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx' 1203, 0.3)``` then ```a.address_lookup('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx')``` ?"

4,1546339762.7529,Raven,Looks reasonable to me
4,1546339902.7549,Conchita,"Great, thanks for the explanation! This is probably a stupid question, but here goes. Would it be possible to create an instance like you showed me here, without providing all arguments I have included in the `def __init__` ? Could i do ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx')```?"
4,1546339926.7551,Raven,You could give those arguments default values

Mr.Harold is a well known scientist living on a planet in Alpha Centauri. He came up with a theory that the principle of uncertainity can be reciprocated as follows,

Value Some function tx(di, V) is always greater than the inverse of planks constant where di is collection of diameters of the size of atoms inside a object in space moving with velocity V. tx(di, V) is equal to the sum of all gx(di[i]) functions values modulo V, where di[i] (diameter of ith atom) is a prime integer.

Note: Velocity is always a prime integer.

gx(x) = {
	1                , if x = 1
	2                , if x = 2
	gx(x-1) + gx(x-2), otherwise
}

Note: Diameter of all atoms are given in order of fermi-meters

Can you help Mr.Harold to design an efficient algorithm for calculating the value the function tx() ?

Constaints:
-&gt; 1 &lt;= Velocity &lt;= 10^12

35,1546519028.9082,Stepanie,"Hi guys, I was wondering if there was anyone around to help me with a Slack bot issue, they seemed to have removed the legacy webhook and you now need to create an App. but no matter what I try, I am unable to get the bots username or icon to come through. has anyone got any experience with how to do this?"
35,1546519088.9087,Jimmy,I have a bit of experience in that. afaik the easiest way is to set the username and icon on the bot settings
35,1546519124.9093,Stepanie,"Oh, I did set the username on the bot settings, and that works, but I didn't see an option for the icon?"
35,1546519205.9095,Jimmy,None; you can click on the icon to change it

I want to have a class with a “delete” method that receives a “path” argument that points to a folder, but it can either be a local folder (ie: ~/foo) or an s3 folder… is there any libs or functions that will know how to delete folders from different types of “storages”?"
38,1546522834.9209,Valeri,I would be surprised if there is one. Like really surprised :nerd_face:
38,1546522933.9217,Shanon,well… I think hadoop will do it (???)… I’m wondering if there’s anything “simpler”; looks like there’s an s3 filesystem implementation :scream:; <https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>
38,1546523149.9227,Rocio,"<@Shanon> typically, you're going to use polymorphism for that; so that you either get an `S3Folder` instance or a `LocalFolder` instance, both have a `.delete()` method, and it's easy to manage in every class"

39,1546524766.9341,Stepanie,"Hey guys, I have the following code, If it detects a keyword from the list ""keywords"" It will send a message to slack
If it detects a keyword from BOTH ""keywords"" and ""color_keywords"" then it will send the same message, but with the extra line
``` msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""``` as shown below

I was wondering if it was possible, that when it detected a keyword from BOTH keyword lists instead of just sending an extra line of text like shown above
If it was possible to send another version of ```slack_data``` as shown in ```slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}```
So I would be able to change the color and different options? so maybe if I made a slack_data2 or something

Here is the code

```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            found_kws = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in comment.body.lower()]

            msg = MSG_TEMPLATE.format(
                keyword=found_kws[0],
                permalink=comment.permalink,
                author=comment.author,
                comment_body=comment.body
            )

            if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""

            slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}

                data=json.dumps(slack_data),
                headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}```

I am still quite new to Python and trying to find my way around things, but this really has me stumped!
Any help would be really appreciated!"
39,1546525323.9342,Asha,"If I'm understanding you correctly, I believe the easiest way to accomplish this is to set ```slack_data``` inside the if block, and use an else to cover the case that there is no keyword found from the color_keywords list; That way the conditional would be responsible for setting slack_data, and you could cover both cases"
40,1546526152.9377,Candi,I am beginner and was writing a code that is a function that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or visa versa. In the code I have given a default argument function as 40 degree Celsius but it is not able take the default values. What am I doing wrong.
40,1546526221.9383,Rocio,"<@Candi> unrelated: it's ""vice versa"", not ""visa versa"""
39,1546526226.9385,Rocio,"and you probably want `temp=40, bol=0`; strings and integers are not the same thing"
40,1546526451.9408,Candi,<@Rocio> sorry for the typo
39,1546526464.9413,Rocio,"you also probably want `FarenheitToCelsius` and `CelsiusToFarenheit`, it's better practice."
39,1546526478.9415,Stepanie,Oh really? it's possible to do it that way?
39,1546526501.9421,Candi,"do you mean this def TempConv(temp=40,bol=0):"
39,1546526515.9423,Rocio,yes
39,1546526588.9428,Candi,thank you it worked thank you; sorry stupid me; okay ill keep this in mind Thank you; Also in the terminal window on line 5 none has been  added. Why is it so ?
39,1546526811.9442,Stepanie,"So for example. the if block is currently ```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            found_kws = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in comment.body.lower()]```
How would I go about putting the slack_data into that?

And then I guess I would be changing ```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""``` to an else statement? and then make a slack_data2 for it to read from?
I did try changing if to else on that, but got an error (as you would expect) like I said, I am still quite new and trying to figure it all out"
39,1546526811.9444,Candi,my code do not a mention of none
39,1546526841.9448,Kiera,"if a function does not explicitly `return` a value, then it returns `None`"
39,1546526882.9454,Candi,alright thank you
39,1546526896.9456,Sau,hello guys; I have an EC2 instance runing on ubuntu and the python program with virtualenv; My question is how can I run the python script in the background of the linux with virtualenv? even if I close the terminal; what is the command line on linux that could help me achieve this?
39,1546527088.9479,Kiera,have you created a virtual environment using the `virtualenv` command?
39,1546527105.9482,Sau,yes
39,1546527107.9484,Kiera,okay.
39,1546527113.9487,Sau,but everytime I need to run the script; I have to activate the virtualenv
39,1546527134.9498,Ashley,"<@Sau> a virtual env is mostly just a modification to your PATH variable so when you reference python, it looks for the executable in your virtual env's directory first. "
39,1546527160.9508,Kiera,"you can also run the script by using the `bin/python` program in the virtual environment directory.; if you created a virtual environment called `$HOME/venv`, then you would run `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py`"
39,1546527187.9519,Ashley,"If you reference it directly, you mostly don't need the virtual env"
39,1546527213.9525,Jimmy,referencing the python inside the environment is the same as activating and then executing
39,1546527273.9539,Alvina,"does Alembic make sense for tables based on ingesting CSV or other files where the output can change without warning? for example, a client adds or removes certain columns to the file"
39,1546527275.954,Kiera,"alternatively, you can do something like `(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python mypythonscript.py)`; if you put it in `()` parentheses, you can then put the entire thing in the backgrouund `(…) &amp;`."
39,1546527316.9548,Sau,so; what is the $HOME
39,1546527334.956,Kiera,but just running directly from the virtual environment's `python` is easier:  `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py &amp;`
39,1546527346.9566,Sau,Can I do source /venv/bin/python …
39,1546527360.9572,Ashley,HOME is another environment variable like PATH
39,1546527371.9576,Kiera,replace `$HOME/venv` with the path to your virtual environment.  That was just an example.
39,1546527371.9577,Ashley,It just says where your home directory is
39,1546527387.9582,Sau,ah; I can do pwd to see the path
39,1546527408.9588,Kiera,"so - if you created the virtual environment in `/tmp/mypython`, you would use `/tmp/mypython/bin/python`."
39,1546527444.9594,Sau,Yeah so I have the src code being outside of the env package; I think I can do ()
39,1546527463.9602,Kiera,where the source code lives doesn't actually matter.
39,1546527466.9604,Sau,(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python src/mypythonscript.py)
39,1546527490.9609,Kiera,"the virtual environment directory is there to contain the python modules that are installed in that virtual environment, not to contain your source code that is using that python."
39,1546527515.9615,Ashley,Yep
39,1546527524.962,Kiera,so you can use `…/venv/bin/python src/mypythonscript.py` directly no matter where the virtual environment and/or `mypythonscript.py` are.
39,1546527559.9629,Sau,ah; So I can use the () parantheses to indicate the linux to run background right?; Like (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/myphthon.py)
39,1546527685.965,Kiera,"no, the `()` are to allow you to group commands together into a subshell and run the group of commands in the background."
39,1546527686.9651,Ashley,The python executable for your virtual env is basically hardcore to look at those directories in that venv's directory
39,1546527863.9655,Sau,"So i did the following thing; (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp;; it is working okay but when it exit the terminal; it is opted out; hmm, I am wondering what I do wrong"
39,1546528052.9686,Clemmie,"You need to use either `nohup` before the command, which tells it to ignore the logout (the `&amp;` just sends it to the background)  Alternatively, and I think better, you can run everything in `tmux`, which gives you a terminal that persists between sessions"
39,1546528090.9692,Sau,"nohup (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp;
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python’; when I did the nohup , but the seems like to have the error"
39,1546528105.97,Kiera,first off; you don't use the `()` if you only are running a single command.
39,1546528214.9709,Sau,ah; Cool Cool; :smile:
39,1546528230.9718,Rocio,"or better yet, use a systemd service or whatever your supervisor is"
39,1546528250.9723,Kiera,"it also should be possible to do this without `nohup`, since `nohup` will annoyingly create a file `nohup.out` with the output from the script.; you can try this:
```
/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/app.py &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
```"
39,1546528285.9737,Sau,May I ask for the alternative way <@Kiera>?
39,1546528317.9741,Kiera,"try that, see if it works to continue running the script after the shell exits."
39,1546528442.9744,Rocio,`nohup ... &gt; /dev/null` works too if you don't want the nohup.out file
39,1546528512.975,Kiera,"okay.  that doesn't work for all versions of nohup, but if it works for debian, that's great."
41,1546528520.9752,Sau,both ways are working find; fine*
41,1546528530.9759,Rocio,"ah, fun"
39,1546528532.9761,Sau,Thank you <@Rocio> and <@Kiera>
41,1546528533.9762,Rocio,"```If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if possible,
'$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.
If standard error is a terminal, redirect it to standard output.
To save output to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND &gt; FILE'.

NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.
```"
39,1546528537.9764,Sau,it is all fun
41,1546528551.9767,Rocio,didn't know shells had a built-in `nohup`
39,1546528608.9776,Sau,so I guess with the java jar build file; I could do the same thing
41,1546528630.9782,Rocio,"I wonder which shell has this built-in... not bash, from what I can see"
39,1546528679.9788,Kiera,"some versions of `sh`, `ksh`, `zsh`, `csh`.; (and `csh` variants)"
39,1546528729.9793,Sau,so <@Kiera>
41,1546528745.9799,Sau,what if I have the java.jar file
41,1546528746.9801,Rocio,"for zsh I can only see a plugin, not core"
41,1546528755.9806,Sau,is this command working in the backgorund ?
41,1546528787.982,Kiera,"<@Rocio> ah, i haven't used zsh, but i thought i remembered it having `nohup` built in."
39,1546528789.9822,Sau,home/ubuntu/booking-calendar-clx/booking-back-end/build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
39,1546528809.9828,Clemmie,I would still suggest working in tmux - it gets rid of all these issues because the tmux shell itself persists. I haven’t had to use `nohup` or `&amp;` in the 4 years since I started using tmux
41,1546528828.9833,Kiera,<@Clemmie> that's fine if you're doing interactive work that you want to get back to.  it's not a solution for automated processes.
39,1546528860.9842,Clemmie,oh - is this supposed to be automated a the end? It read like <@Sau> wants to fire it off and leave the session
41,1546528877.9849,Sau,yep yep; :smile:
39,1546528883.9853,Kiera,yep yep which? :)
39,1546528905.9858,Sau,just kicks off the execution and exit the terminal
41,1546528906.986,Sau,:smile:
39,1546528932.9868,Rocio,"<@Clemmie> the _correct_ solution is to use a supervisor, such as systemd, runit, supervisord, etc"
39,1546528948.9875,Asha,"Something like this possibly for the color keyword part ``` if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': *msg_1*, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}

41,1546528954.9879,Clemmie,"For automation <@Rocio>, absolutely."
39,1546528962.9883,Clemmie,This sounds like a desire to do it interactively though
39,1546528963.9884,Kiera,"<@Sau> :
a)  are these commands that you are running by hand, or do you want to run them automatically (cron, or run in docker containers, etc.) ?
b)  do you care about capturing the output of the programs that get run ?"
39,1546528979.9886,Asha,"Using nested if statements isn't great, and I'm sure someone else could help you with something better, but that's the quick and dirty way I would think of first, before refactoring"
39,1546529000.9896,Sau,"so these commands are basically running by hand , and really want to run them automatically"
41,1546529004.9899,Asha,Does that make sense?
39,1546529008.9903,Sau,and also i don;’t care about the ouput; :smile:
39,1546529035.9914,Kiera,"do you need to run them in sequence?  (i.e. first run X, then run Y, then run Z)"
39,1546529043.9919,Sau,ah no
39,1546529054.9923,Clemmie,I enjoy supervisor <@Rocio>. But a question if you are well versed at it. Do you have a good way to restart a supervisorctl on system restart? I’ve not yet come across a great solution that doesn’t feel hacky
39,1546529059.9925,Sau,they are all runing indepentdently
39,1546529135.9944,Kiera,<@Sau> do you know how they will be automatically run?
39,1546529154.9948,Clemmie,<@Sau> <@Kiera> - Maybe cron then? It handles this cleanly by default. It would be perfect if you want it to run automatically at specified times and recurrence intervals
39,1546529178.9952,Kiera,"<@Clemmie> yes, that's what i'm trying to get to :)"
39,1546529188.9955,Rocio,<@Clemmie> systemd service :slightly_smiling_face:

39,1546529209.9969,Rocio,I prefer using whatever init I'm using on the system
39,1546529210.997,Sau,let me try with crob
41,1546529218.9974,Clemmie,"<@Rocio> yeah, that still feels a little hacky, like I should have just used systemd to start"
39,1546529232.998,Rocio,"well, you could"
39,1546529269.9991,Clemmie,tech debt i guess
39,1546529286.9996,Rocio,systemd has a lot of options related to being a supervisor

42,1546544772.0134,Magan,"Hey you sexy people. Quick question on this but I have Tkinter application that when it launches on execution does eveything except change the title from displaying ""tk"" despite that the line in the app specifically has. Is there something else I can look for?

Sample code below
```
#!/bin/env python3

__version__ = 1.0
__author__ = ""Ru""

import tkinter
from tkinter import ttk, filedialog
from tkinter.constants import *

# Program Version
testapp = <http://tkinter.Tk|tkinter.Tk>()
testapp.configure({'padx':10})

# Set Window Title
testapp.title = (""blu.py {}"".format(__version__))
testapp.mainloop()

```"
42,1546545376.0142,Sasha,"I think `title` is actually a function, not a property."
42,1546546184.0144,Magan,"OMG.; You know what let me test that out. Im probably that dumb
Edit: Yes I am that dumb.; Thank you <@Sasha>"
42,1546546516.0166,Sasha,Easy mistake to make. I looked at like 3 examples online and didn't notice either.
43,1546549625.0185,Candra,I'm trying to write some sphinx documentation for the whole codebase I've built at my job. My question whether or not I should use the current source directory which is the parent of all the code I've written and just have the one Sphinx build OR use intersphinx in the multiple projects I have
43,1546550142.0192,Bethany,if all the source is under one parent i'd probably just do `parent/docs`; and put it there
44,1546552004.0197,Cammie,"Lets say I have a little game that’s two players, so I have so functions

`playerTwoMoves(int coordinate)`
`playerOneMoves(int coordinate)`

This seems like a pretty bad design, as _if_ I want to support lets say three players, I’ll have to copy and paste a new function with almost the same functionality. How would you solve this?

I could have a single function that takes in a player id

`playerMoves(int playerId, int coordinate)`

but are there other or better options? I know I could use enums, or turn this into an OO design, *but what would you do?*; I was addressing this problem from a testing point of view, cause I noticed my tests were the same for:

`playerTwoMoves(int coordinate)`
`playerOneMoves(int coordinate)`

and then noticed the amount of duplicated code and I didn’t like it"
44,1546552455.0234,Candra,"I think the single function is definitely nicer as they're both doing the same thing except with less code. The ID will work, but that entirely depends on how you identify a player. If you are not using an OO pattern then the ID is fine, if you want to use OO then you could simply create a player class and generate a new player object per person and also give them IDs.; <@Bethany> Yeah, I think I may just write documentation within the code and clean up the code base. I feel like the majority of the concern I have, since I'm leaving this job, is that the sheer amount of code I've developed in my time here is pretty overwhelming to someone new coming in and most of what I've written are small scripts. Maybe simply writing docs within each script is a better/easier approach that way documentation written by whoever takes my spot here can be done in the same fashion without me having to also write documentation about writing docstrings etc...; So basically write documentation for each script since I don't really have much in the way of modules with lots of functions. Just scripts that generate different reports etc..."
44,1546552691.0274,Cammie,"Awesome, thanks for the input kbman. I think I’m just overthinking such a simple project.

I just really want to do a great write up about this and don’t want to showcase poor code ha thanks"
44,1546552721.0279,Candra,"<@Cammie> No worries, I suffer from the same thing just as my question above might show lol; I think either way works. Lots of people have their own opinions on OO and what not. A lot of my current code is not OO while some is, it really just depends on the use case. I think you'll be fine whatever you decide to do, but I'd say if you can just make the two separate functions into one."
44,1546552835.0293,Renetta,"I have run into a bit of a dead lock with a dictionary iteration, Can you point me where this is going wrong ?
The above is working for me however I'd like a different approach using for key,val in (dict): one is there any way we can do that ?"
44,1546553152.0309,Candra,"`for _, val in records['main']['sub'].items()`"
44,1546553523.0317,Bethany,"<@Candra> I'd focus first on writing decent docstrings. In particularly, use doctest and a python REPL to generate examples of usage; you can add sphinx later"
44,1546553553.0322,Candra,The &gt;&gt;&gt; format?
44,1546553580.0331,Renetta,"yeah sorry, should've done that. My bad"
44,1546553583.0333,Candra,And yeah I've got every function documented. I'll be spending the next week or so writing more detailed information
44,1546553669.0336,Bethany,yeah like; here's an example from one of mine; None; it's not the best but I find the examples help a lot
44,1546553996.0356,Candra,Okay cool. I currently am using the reStructedText docstrings. I'll basically get everything well documented and then decide if I need to use Sphinx. Thanks <@Bethany> :taco:
44,1546554019.0358,Bethany,oh yeah i use napoleon
44,1546554147.0363,Candra,I'll check it out. I like the idea of having the examples
44,1546554208.0367,Shan,"yea, the examples are a nice touch."

46,1546559190.0382,Hai,yes <@Sasha> I will try that now; <@Sasha> am getting an error string indices must be integer
46,1546559512.039,Sasha,Sounds like your actual data may be different than the example.

46,1546559686.041,Kiera,<@Hai> can you post the complete example code that you're running and the actual error message?
46,1546559747.0417,Shan,I feel like that’s usually me asking that question.  thank you for doing the same.; :taco: for <@Kiera> for keeping solutions sane.
46,1546559826.0425,Hai,None; <@Sasha> <@Shan> <@Kiera>
46,1546559954.0439,Sasha,"Yeah, you're missing list brackets and commas around the dicts."
46,1546560017.0449,Hai,oh is there any way to make a valid JSON?
46,1546560048.0452,Sasha,Can you rephrase the question?
46,1546560133.0465,Kiera,"a valid JSON object is a dictionary at the top level.  so what you would need to do is something like:
```
response={
    u""response"": [
        {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
        {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
        {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
    ]
}
```"
46,1546560250.0483,Hai,<@Kiera> in my output at the top level also it's not a dictionary; <@Sasha> how to make my output a valid JSON so that I can print the keys and values
46,1546560341.0509,Shan,"```response= {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}``` this isn’t valid python."
46,1546560343.0511,Kiera,"<@Hai> your post still does not make sense.  please make one post with a valid python script that demonstrates the problem you are having, and a second post with the output from that script, and a third post describing what you expected."
46,1546560357.0512,Leana,Knowing how to ask a good question is a highly invaluable skill that will benefit you greatly in any career. <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> is a good collection of suggestions and strategies to help you structure and phrase your question to make it easier for those here to understand your problem and help you work to a solution.
46,1546560445.0528,Kiera,"<@Hai> in general:  JSON = JavaScript Object Notation.  It uses JavaScript syntax to describe an ""object"" (which is represented in Python as a dictionary).  Objects contain keys which are strings (and only strings) mapped to values which may be numbers, strings, objects, or arrays of numbers, strings, objects, or arrays.; in order to produce valid JSON, you need to produce a dictionary which has string keys and values of the appropriate types described above, and feed that dictionary to `json.dumps`."
46,1546560804.0542,Hai,None
46,1546560902.0549,Kiera,"try this:
```
print(type(data))
```; oh.; yes.; you did `data = json.dumps(response)`; `json.dumps` converts a python object into a string holding the JSON representation of that object.; you then did `for item in data` which loops through each character of the string."
46,1546560997.0578,Hai,"<@Kiera> so should i remove the json.dumps and directly loop through response?? but response has ""u"" is it okay?/"
46,1546561084.0594,Kiera,"i don't know what `request` and `response` are, so i can't tell you whether looping through response is what you need to do.  if `response` is a Python list, or something that acts like a Python list, then `for item in response` would work in the loop at the bottom.; * that is, if it acts like a list of dictionaries which have a `""temp""` key that contains another dictionary with `""a""` and `""b""` keys...; what happens if you do `print(repr(response))` ?"
46,1546561168.0611,Hai,<@Kiera> i didnt try i will try noew; now*
46,1546561232.0616,Kiera,"anyway, i need to get going."
46,1546561562.0624,Hai,<@Shan> is there any way to make that output to a valid JSON?
46,1546561621.0625,Shan,"<@Hai>; you could also do ```response = [ {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}} ]```"
46,1546561738.0637,Hai,<@Shan> how would I add square brackets and commas after each json?
46,1546561794.0642,Shan,"alright.  so backing up.  give me the script you are working with.; are you saying that when you `request.get(my_url)`, you are getting the following as a response? ```
{u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
{u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
{u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}```"
46,1546561912.0656,Hai,<@Shan> yes perfect
47,1546561981.066,Shan,Alright.
46,1546562037.0672,Shan,"split on a newline, `\n`, and iterate through each line, and jsonify the line, and append to a list."
46,1546562153.0681,Hai,<@Shan> how would we know the json ends at the same line? my each json is very large
46,1546562238.0685,Shan,okay…do you have control over what the source outputs?
46,1546562250.069,Hai,<@Shan>; yes
46,1546562262.0697,Shan,the smarter thing would be to fix the service you’re `get`ting from to output proper json.
46,1546562315.0711,Hai,<@Shan> no no i dont have that control on that
46,1546562318.0712,Shan,the next way would be to create some functions that iterate through lines and pieces together valid json through a series of checks.; but that method would be taxing.
46,1546562385.0724,Hai,<@Shan> yeahh
46,1546562451.0735,Shan,"Maybe not.  you could iterate through each line, count the first iteration of `[` or `{` and then count the open brackets before the closing one so that you can intelligently navigate full json.; why does the service give you this format for info?"
46,1546562560.0753,Hai,<@Shan>I can try that. I don't know it's coming from a different app. I mean actually am getting in that format. did you see my code?; None
46,1546562605.0758,Shan,"oh dear lord.; i incorrectly assumed.  although, i cant see why `response.json()` or `json.dumps(response)` would work."
46,1546562727.0772,Hai,"<@Shan> yeahh but after doing json.dumps() it is juts removing the ""u""  but still not giving a valid json"
46,1546562958.0784,Shan,maybe just `split('=')` and hope that its never in the data.  then `split('\n')` and hope that newlines only exist at the and of a “json” line.; work backwards from there as errors crop up due to this sillyness.
46,1546563012.0791,Hai,yeahh i will try
46,1546563492.0793,Shan,"so, this is crude af."
46,1546563503.0795,Hai,hahahha
46,1546563612.08,Shan,i’m not proud of it.  theres a few things you can do to clean this up but…the gist.; but. i challenge you to inspect you data better.; see what you can do to manipulate it to fit your needs.
46,1546563790.082,Sasha,"Hahaha. I'd be worried about the `u""` substitution, if any data contents end with a ""u""."
46,1546563817.0825,Hai,<@Shan> sure
46,1546563831.083,Shan,oh. im concerned about much of it.  i dont understand how that output from a url is valid output.
46,1546563831.0831,Sasha,"""Just `eval` it!""  &lt;runs and hides&gt;"
46,1546563853.0835,Shan,"i mean…i understand it, but it makes me sad."
46,1546563867.0838,Hai,<@Shan> yaaa even metoo
46,1546563920.0846,Shan,"so yea.  manipulate the data to fit your needs.  remember, youre a wizard now, learn some new spells, make the data bend to your ~wishes~ manipulations."
46,1546563961.0853,Hai,<@Shan> yeahh but how did you add space after each individual json at line7 ?; <@Shan> i didnt see any space but the new json is starting from a new line so should i assume there is a space between each individual json?
46,1546564091.0883,Shan,"so, im not querying this endpoint so i dont know what its doing…but when i pasted it into my term, it automatically created `\n` that i was able to split on.  `\n` can be invisible characters.; ```resp = request.get(my_url)

print(resp.split('\n'))
```; try that first.; see what it does."

I have a conceptual problem, and I hope I describe it clearly.

I am making a script that logs into a ticket selling website, picks a pass level, and goes through each event in the calendar to confirm if certain discounts are applied.

Logically, I’m a bit stumped. I’m selecting users by text with Selenium. And I select by drop down menu based on a loop that goes through the entire index of choices in the drop down (also Selenium). I can get all this to work.

How should I set up the structure to pick a new user once it’s gone through all the events? Should that be another block of the same code w/ a different username selected? Or could I create a loop that picks a new user once all the events are tested?"

63,1546689244.1881,Raven,<@Shellie> There's nothing in your existing code that tries to extract individual cells based on position. It looks like you're just throwing every single cell in most of the tables into `values`

63,1546690528.1938,Raven,"You're probably overwriting something each time you enter that loop; This, for example:

63,1546690619.1952,Raven,"You overwrite `top_post_likes` each time; Similarly, what do you think `post_info.update` does? It will be overwriting that data in `post_info`; If in doubt, print out everything at each stage, then compare it to what you expected to see. You'll get a feel for when you're doing the right thing.; (I'm not convinced your min/max/avg calculations are correct either - they seem to be rolling values which seems like an odd choice)"
63,1546691027.1973,Lucius,"i tested them actually, afaik they were correct; the thing I'm doing actually is feeding my script a .txt file with keywords. Then scraping IG for the post data of each of those tags.

63,1546691203.1988,Raven,Sure. Not sure how that relates to what we were saying though
63,1546691399.1994,Lucius,I probably didn't fully understand your remark about the calc's :slightly_smiling_face:
63,1546691545.2003,Raven,"The comment about the calculations is that your first time through the loop the min/max/avg will be the same (as you only have one data point to work with), then the next time you'll have 2, then 3; It's possible that is what you intend, but it's hard for me to imagine a data set where that would be true"
63,1546691603.2014,Lucius,"I think I did it that way, to be able to use min &amp; max later on. Because each time i perform the loop, I would be adding the next value to the list"
63,1546691656.2021,Raven,"Well, it looks wrong to me, but only you can know for sure, because I don't know what you intend; Also - I don't think you really want to do this `likes_value = comments_value = []`; ```

68,1546710084.2162,Sasha,"<@Mathilde> What your code does is convert all the numbers to strings and then concatenate them, so `my_str` ends up as `""424911""`. Then the for loop iterates over it one character at a time, converting back to int, so `my_list` would be `[4, 2, 4, 9, 1, 1]`. Then the `max` function correctly finds the maximum value of 9."

Hi all, I'm a total newbie to Python (I'm a JS developer), but I have a specific task I'm trying to achieve with it....
I want to create an MP3/WAV comprising of an audio clip that is repeated at specific time intervals (which are taken from an array of microseconds that I already have). This is for usage as a drummer's click track.

Basically I need to load an MP3/WAV clip, loop through the array of microseconds, set the clip at these times and then output a single MP3 file.

*Is this possible with Python?*

I've looked at several audio libraries such as Librosa but can't find any hints on how I could achieve this!
Thanks!"
78,1546777981.3043,Jettie,Python has something in standard library: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html>; should be enough to do basic things like composing a stream out of chunks
78,1546778244.3057,Shyla,"<@Jettie> Thanks, just read the documentation but can't see a clear way of doing this. Is it something a beginner could achieve?"

78,1546789940.3108,Shyla,"<@Raven> Sorry the measurements are in milliseconds. I cannot use a DAW as I need to snap the samples to the timings from the original MP3. This is not in constant time, so I cannot simply use a grid at a set BPM; So far I have used Librosa to successfully detect every beat and the timings of these. Now I just need to place my sample wav/mp3 at the same timings and create a single mp3 file.

Hence a GUI or another language is used as a way to display the logic, and or data to a user. UI/UX is the methodology of making that GUI or Display language(HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, as a few examples) Play nicely with users in a fashion that makes it easier for users to understand with out needing to know what goes into the product. Also with markdown, it is a language similar to HTML and slack uses it to interpret the messages typed into the chat boxes, as such symbols such as  _  etc, have special abilities granted to them through the markdown language so it may not be  UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation, or lack of enough markdown syntax knowledge; Udemy has some good programing courses, I teach python at a school here in Utah, but it is not a cheap option, there are also a lot of free resources on line, but they tend to be un organized and you have to be careful that you find current resources, as a lot of stuff out there can be out of date and not of much use for current development practices."

- there are py UI 'frameworks' that are made with py, and that is all UI/UX so this is categorically inaccurate -- 'hence being called backend language) Python as such has very little if any direct contact with a user'
- &amp; so it is supposely the case that the relevant info imma looking for does not exist in the brains of ppl that do/know &amp; limited to to  'back-end only/mostly'
- maybe what is intended to be said is that py was originally meant/made for only for 'back-end' and has never advanced since, or that ppl's knowledge have not at the same pace as py

'UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation' -- 'markdown is a UI/UX interface, &amp; thereby it is fundamentally a UI/UX limitation, and this is obvious to 99.9% of ppl/users

80,1546803629.3626,Clint,"UI/UX is not the software you are looking at, the software a user looks at is what is known as a Front End coding languages, UI, is the methodology is the process of using front end languages like HTML, Markdown, styling such as CSS, in a way so that a User can Interact with the program that has been written, it does not need to be a great experience but a user needs to be able to push a button and the desired effect happens, UI is setting up that button, Back end languages such as Python and Ruby, C# etc, are what make the Button do something.

UX is a methodology that improves the User Experience,  sure you have a button and it does something, but is it intuitive and was it easy for the user to figure out what to do with a minimal amount of explanation.  You combine the 2 to improve the over all usage of the application be it a web site, web app mobile app etc.

In fact because most of the work that goes in to UI/UX is in User research and design, Often the UI/UX lead does very little if any actual programing. They are very customer facing and need to know the current flows in styles in the market, try and improve UX, etc, Most of my friend who work in UI/UX work directly with a front end engineering team so that they (the front end team) can program out the Design and the UI/UX based on his (the UI/UX engineer) research, The Front End team will work with the Back End team to make sure the functionality is happening as it should. The languages Used in Front end languages will always have some direct correlation to restrictions on what can be done from a UI/UX point of view, but as they improve the options on how to use them Will improve as well.

This is very simplified as there are a lot more moving pieces, but I hope that gives you a better Idea of what is going on.

Good luck in your programing journey"

94,1546891858.5282,Jennifer,"I guess I can write more than once to the file using a loop.; Appending to the file, I mean."
94,1546891893.529,Clemmie,Or make it a nested dict <@Jennifer>
94,1546891910.5296,Jennifer,"Note that ""targets"" is repeated there.; And it is on the same level.; So it would need to have the same key.; Correct me if I'm wrong."
94,1546891976.5317,Clemmie,"Yeah `{""targets"": [{""labels"":{""cluster"": ""cluster1"", ""dc"":""dc1""}},}` etc...; Oh, if you require that structure, then yeah, you want a list of dicts"
94,1546892035.533,Jennifer,"List of dicts or append to the file. I'm using loops anyway.; Thanks, misthop!"
94,1546892053.5339,Clemmie,yw
94,1546892219.5347,Jennifer,"One more thing. Can my dict contain a list as a value?

94,1546892814.5399,Maricela,I have two different servers that have different pip packages and different versions of packages. I want one server to match what I have on the other server. Is it safe to remove all packages on the target server and install with requirements.txt file from the source server?; The code on both will be the same
94,1546892866.541,Clemmie,"Not the best practice. Most OS have system python and will depend on some of the installed packages. Use virtual environments; In particular, I’m pretty sure you will destroy an OS X install doing that"
94,1546892941.5426,Kiera,"or centos/redhat/etc.  if you try to remove the python packages, you'll remove `yum`."
94,1546892952.5427,Maricela,"Good to know. Thanks.; Alternatively, if I ran the requirements.txt would it overwrite any existing packages or install only the ones missing?"
94,1546894024.5446,Clemmie,It could replace with different versions - also not a good result. You really want to keep your system python and app python environments separate
94,1546894073.5454,Maricela,Ok. Looks like I need to start migrating things to a virtualenv.; thank you
94,1546894142.5468,Clemmie,"Very little to migrate. Create a virtualenv in your preferred way (mkvirtualenv, pyenv, venv, etc.) Activate the env, pip install, and then run as you would"
94,1546894223.5472,Maricela,So I wouldn't have to move my django project into that venv?
94,1546894301.5484,Clemmie,"Nope. In fact that is an anti-pattern. Having an activated virtual env basically changes your python path to the virtual env from system python, and installs packages in the virtual env’s file structure."
94,1546894397.5488,Maricela,Nice. I'll get started on that then. Thanks again.

The above link get updated every 5 min
I have exported the data from the link to pandas dataframe and from DataFrame to database using sqlalchemy.
I want the data to be updated to the database and this time it should only enter the latest data not the entire data(Every 5 min one row)
I have taken data in two tables in the database and then I am merging
```INSERT INTO customers1 SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (SELECT date from customers) != (SELECT date from customers1);```
Is there any way to update the single database from pandas to sqlite database?"
95,1546928207.5807,Sasha,"I can't answer your question, but do note that `outputsize=compact` would give you only the 100 most recent data points, so maybe that will be easier to merge than getting the whole history every query."
101,1546928288.5814,Chad,Yes but again 100 I need to save it into other temp database and then merge; Is there any way i can save the data from pandas to database without `dataframe.to_sql`; ?
101,1546928911.5837,Sasha,"Well, I mean you could use a different database API, but within the pandas framework, it looks like `to_sql()` is the main method. You can use it to append to an existing table, though, with `if_exists='append'`."
101,1546929536.5848,Chad,`if_exists=append` is add the same data i.e if the data has 1135 rows after `append` it is showing 2270 rows
101,1546929667.5857,Sasha,"Ah, in that case you probably want to filter your dataframe first, such as only keeping any points whose timestamp is greater than the maximum one already in the database."
101,1546929780.586,Chad,can you please tell me how ?; I didnot get
101,1546930202.5885,Sasha,"Well, you could get the maximum timestamp in the database with a `SELECT MAX(date_column)` query. And then use Pandas to select that data: `data[data['date_column'] &gt; max_date]`."

102,1546937904.5928,Linnie,xD this is hilarious :stuck_out_tongue: would be more so if it were java :smile:
103,1546939418.5929,Conchita,"Hope this is clear. What would be the most pythonic solution to returning data out of this method?

I have a MongoDB that contains simple data of bank accounts including historical balances. The data is structured like this:

```_id:""3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r""
balances: 
    0:
    balance: 138661
    date: 2018-11-06 08:00:00.000

    1:
    balance: 138660
    date: 2018-11-07 08:00:00.000```

My goal here is to count how many accounts are increasing their account balance, decreasing  their account balance or neither during a given period, to compute the share between them.

When I run the code below, I get ```{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 1, 'idle': 0}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 1, 'idle': 0}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}```; I'm unsure if I should store this in a dict, in pandas etc; It's my first go at interacting with MongoDB"
103,1546939575.5946,Jimmy,imo you kind of have the correct idea but it's a the wrong place; what I would do is have `classify_activity` return one of `increasing` `decreasing` or `idle`; and in your loop over each account (in the bottom) increment the corresponding counter; does that makes sense ?
103,1546939834.5969,Conchita,Does make sense. But I'm a bit unsure how to pull it off. I modified my method like this; What I'm confused about now is how to check the return value?
103,1546939908.5987,Jimmy,"&gt; What I'm confused about now is how to check the return value?

You can't because in this case they are all the same; you have to find a way to make them different; the simple way is just to return a different string for each condition"
103,1546939949.6,Conchita,Aha! Of course
103,1546939988.6008,Jimmy,"the best is to return the exact string that you use as key in your counter so you can do; ```
x = classify()
my_counter[x] += 1
```"
103,1546940397.6015,Conchita,"I was a little confused about the way you set up `my_counter[x] += 1` so I tried the solution below which seemed to do the trick. Would be great if you could have a look <@Jimmy>; It returned the output ```{'increasing': 4, 'decreasing': 2, 'idle': 0}``` which is correct"
103,1546940430.6025,Jimmy,nice :thumbsup:; in your case you are running `run.classify_activity()` 3 times for each account; and that's not really necessary
103,1546940466.6037,Conchita,Oh don't wanna do that
103,1546940473.6039,Jimmy,you could store that in a variable and compare afterwards
103,1546940567.6054,Conchita,How can I check the string returned from the method without running it unnecessary like I currently do?
103,1546940594.6059,Jimmy,"like you would do for any return value / variable; ```
activity = run.classify_activity()
if activity == ""increasing"":
  ...
```"
103,1546940668.6068,Conchita,Of course :slightly_smiling_face:; Thanks for the help! Really appreciate all the help I get in this group from people like yourself! Makes the life for a beginner so much easier! Have a :taco: <@Jimmy>
103,1546940753.6083,Jimmy,always a pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:; One more thing in the example you showed the `else` is also incrementing `increasing` where it should be `idle`

108,1546966739.6393,Clemmie,"<@Nenita> you are getting that error because `datetime.now()` note the parens, is a method - you are referencing the when you skip the parens, not calling it. Then you also need to do as <@Sasha> said for the date you are passing to your function"

113,1546994853.6794,Ardath,Jesus how did I miss that; Thanks <@Sasha> :taco:; It's late :tired_face:; Here's my predicament; None; Can anyone think of a solution?
113,1546997115.6826,Shan,convert `Q()` to an attr?

113,1546997248.6844,Shan,"`db_query = ""Q(""brand_names""='AMD') | Q(""brand_names""='Intel')""`"
113,1546997350.6848,Ardath,<@Shan> Not sure I'm with you; Should probably add `Q` is imported from mongoengine
113,1546997396.6861,Shan,your first post shows that `Q` is an object.; db_query has no objects.
113,1546997481.6878,Ardath,"Trying to think about how to query the db dynamically; With random k, v's coming in from requests"
113,1546997516.6887,Shan,im not familiar with your library but `getattr` _may_ work.; youre using `mongoengine`?
113,1546997586.6895,Ardath,"yeah mongoengine, latest"
113,1546997640.6899,Shan,:facepalm: `from mongoengine import *`
113,1546997672.6904,Sasha,So you may need to play a `**kwargs` trick with creating `Q()` objects from dynamic parameters.
113,1546997700.6907,Ardath,<@Shan> Everything is imported haha; Just not included in the snippet
113,1546997716.6913,Shan,"yea, their tutorial is garbage like that."
113,1546997779.6924,Ardath,<@Sasha> yeah that's what I'm trying to work out; There's got to be a better way
113,1546997838.6934,Shan,"so first, `query.append(f""Q({k}='{x}')"")` you’ll need to ensure `Q()` is an object…right now its a string."
113,1546997857.6936,Ardath,basically yes; and each `Q` needs to be separated with a `|`
113,1546997903.6943,Shan,<http://docs.mongoengine.org/guide/querying.html#querying-lists>
113,1546997935.6945,Sasha,"There may be an easier way to do this if there's a ""blank Q"" object to start with. Or maybe do a reduce with operator-OR."
113,1546997994.695,Shan,:taco: <@Sasha> for functional
113,1546998119.6962,Sasha,There's also apparently a `__raw__=` syntax for giving a query as a dict in PyMongo format.
113,1546998119.6963,Ardath,Thank Ed I'll try something like that now
113,1546998166.6969,Sasha,So `Q(__raw__={k: x})` may work instead of the `**kwargs` hack.; This is a case of an API trying to be a bit too clever in blending in with language features...

113,1547004661.7022,Shan,youre doing an `InvalidOperation` on `decimal`.
115,1547004778.7027,Sasha,I'm puzzled by this. I don't get an error when I try the same code.
115,1547004784.7029,Brittanie,why is it an InvalidOperation; which python version are you on ?
115,1547004797.7034,Shan,you tell us.
115,1547004857.7042,Sasha,"I'm on 2.6, so that may be a difference. But I'm not sure why division would be invalid."

115,1547005232.7081,Sasha,Is it the division or the rounding that's throwing the exception?
115,1547005296.7084,Brittanie,rounding; looks like rounding doesn’t work for decimal
115,1547005391.7091,Sasha,There's a `quantize()` method to do it instead.

116,1547006309.7114,Sasha,Are the dates in the database stored as strings or as datetime objects?
116,1547006323.7117,Conchita,datetime objects
116,1547006352.7122,Sasha,So you probably have to compare them to a datetime object in your query.
116,1547006373.7124,Conchita,Could you give me an example?
116,1547006406.713,Sasha,"When you say `== self.date`, that should be a datetime, not a string you're currently passing in."
116,1547006482.7137,Conchita,"Got it, will figure out how to pass a datetime"
116,1547006527.7144,Sasha,"`strptime()` is your friend if you want to start from strings, but you can also construct a datetime from numbers."
116,1547006612.7149,Conchita,Which of the two methods do you prefer?
116,1547006709.7156,Sasha,No strong preference. Ideally you would be getting them from some other database query rather than needing to construct them from scratch.
116,1547006825.7171,Conchita,"Ok, noted! Thanks for the advice"
116,1547006852.7173,Stacy,`strptime()` can have performance implications as well if parsing lots of data vs creating your own solution.
117,1547009155.7176,Conchita,"I got a datetime object here, but why is it returning ```2018-11-06 08:00:00
``` and not adding the fractional seconds when I have included `%f`?"
117,1547009841.7187,Sasha,"Probably just the default print format for the object. It doesn't remember what your string looked like, but you can format it however you like with `strftime()`."
118,1547013182.7192,Conchita,What am I doing wrong here? I get 2 sets of fractional seconds..
116,1547013697.7197,Valeri,2 sets?
118,1547013793.7209,Conchita,"If you compare the first line `date = '2018-11-06 08:00:00.000`
 with the last line you can see what I mean `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000000`; The strftime generates exta `000`; I use this for querying a MongoDB collection, so should be precise"
119,1547017662.7234,Shan,"the docs state that `%f` is int(6); but i’m curious as to why this happens: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime

119,1547018301.7297,Valeri,"Yeah right; <@Conchita> You can actually enforce a check saying whether the `datetime.strftime(x, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")[:-3]` equals `datetime.strftime(x, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")[:23]` and then write to the db; That'll help you sleep better in the night"

123,1547033709.7518,Conchita,"<@Valeri> <@Shan> sorry, I gave you the wrong information. `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000` is string type. I need to pass a datetime and whenever I try to convert `date = '2018-11-06 08:00:00.000'` to a datetime I get `2018-11-06 08:00:00`. When I (think I) need to match exactly my original string format `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000`. My issue is turning that to a datetime object without loosing anything.

My goal here is to query data inside a MongoDB array object, where I first find a specific `_id`, then find the specific object through querying for a specific `date`. ie. I want to find the balance of array object 1 here ```_id:""3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r""

123,1547036397.7719,Valeri,Yeah you're dealing with a lot of records I'm assuming
123,1547036469.7721,Conchita,"Yeah will be 40 collections each with 2000 documents, where each document have 300 sub-documents (stored in array)"
125,1547036487.7723,Conchita,And growing
123,1547036852.7725,Chester,"""A lot of records"" is a fine reason if you're exceeding terrabytes.
40 collections * 2000 documents * 300 sub-documents is just 23 megabytes assuming each document is exactly 1 byte. If each document is around 1kb, then you'll need only 23gb to store everything. Let's add 50% more storage for indexes: 35 GB.
If you have just one 1 TB disk, you're in capacity of storing almost 30 times of the data you have now.; But if mongodb is an external requirement, of course you should follow that"
126,1547037612.773,Conchita,"Good to know! I did originally think of using Postgres, but the external req overruled that"
123,1547037790.7732,Sharolyn,any luck <@Valeri>

131,1547057622.7947,Valeri,"Hey guys,
I have an imminent requirement to learn AWS Elasticsearch within a week. Something urgent has come up.
How do you recommend I go about doing that so that I have some know-how about how to architect my database considering the nature of my data which I already have."
131,1547058370.7953,Claudine,oof that's a tight timeframe
131,1547058531.7955,Hiroko,"very.; I’d start reading about how parsing and tokenization work, then structuring your schema for indexing; that said, a week is very tight and I’d push for a bigger time range; its very easy to get in the mindset “well, google does this crap easily” and forget just what it takes to have good search experience"
131,1547058667.7979,Shan,"once the schema is in place, you may not have the ability to fix it.  leading to a bad experience for all involved as it grows"
131,1547058691.7984,Hiroko,"and when you need to change the schema, you can’t just plop the change in and expect it to work; oftentimes, it’ll require a full reindex, and how long will that take?"
131,1547058770.7993,Sasha,(1) Implement a CSV file and grep. (2) Tell them it's totally using AWS Elasticsearch. (3) Profit!
131,1547058780.7995,Shan,lol
131,1547058966.8002,Claudine,"&gt;oftentimes, it’ll require a full reindex, and how long will that take?
^this too, when I first started at my company a full reindex would take up so much memory it would crash before finishing; well we had scripts to run the reindexing and those would crash"
131,1547059005.8009,Shan,we process 90G of logs a day.
131,1547059037.8012,Claudine,damn that's a log of logs; I'm working with 300g of user activity data; trying to build a predictive model
131,1547059059.8022,Shan,fedramp.  EVERYTHING touched has to be logged.
131,1547059103.8033,Sasha,Heh heh. I used to get paged when we dipped below a petabyte of free space.  :sweat:
131,1547059110.8035,Hiroko,"at work, a full reindex of all the content takes about 3 days"
131,1547059177.805,Shan,<@Valeri> the take away here is that we highly recommend you push your date back as much as possible so that you can properly research the topic and get comfortable in producing a viable product that will last.
131,1547059372.8055,Valeri,Okay; Where should I start is what I should've rather asked :stuck_out_tongue:
132,1547059413.8064,Valeri,"So, where do I begin guys?"
131,1547059454.8065,Valeri,Would never have been able to think about something like this rofl :joy:; I second this <@Conchita>
132,1547059537.8071,Shan,well whats your requirement?
132,1547059572.8077,Sasha,Heh. Lots of people end up using Google-scale technology for tiny amounts of simple data. Hopefully whoever made the Elasticsearch decision knows what they're doing...
131,1547059598.8079,Valeri,I've to build a search service that involves a couple TBs of data; <@Sasha> Hope this clarifies it :smile:
132,1547059664.809,Shan,do you know what that data is?
131,1547059680.8095,Valeri,Yes; It's basically details about newspapers; I've to migrate all that data to an Elasticsearch db and then build a search service on top of it using Python/Django; Which will be consumed by the FE using REST APIs
131,1547059799.812,Hiroko,in a _week_?
131,1547059805.8122,Valeri,Nope; One week is for me to get familiarized with Elastic search; So that I'm able to decide initially what my models would look like; Followed by schema migrations and data migrations; Then I commence work on the search service; I will be working with other people after the data has been migrated; But I'm on my own for the first two steps at least
131,1547060327.8159,Shan,sounds like a rollercoaster adventure.
133,1547060367.8165,Leopoldo,"Hi all, can anyone weigh in on how I’ve got this structured? I can successfully choose a user, then loop through every event as that one user.. But I want it x =+ 1 when it’s done there, and start the process over with a new user name. I have my full script too, but I thought simplifying it might make discussion easier."
132,1547060449.8176,Shan,"so, id first stand up a service.  go through the aws getting started pages.  <https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/getting-started/> : look at your data and implement a schema that you think may work.  load up some data and test it out. play with it."
131,1547060478.8182,Shan,"as you get comfortable, i’d start researching topics on how to properly structure your schema to get the best performance for your data.; implement a new schema and play with that while using data.; id start with that anyways"
132,1547060768.8194,Shan,<@Leopoldo> your `search` arg is outside of a defined loop.
132,1547060840.8213,Leopoldo,Thank you <@Shan> I’ll make that change.
133,1547060922.8228,Nenita,"Needing some good input here, but I am having to learn new modules and methods as I work on whatever I am developing. Currently I am having to have my system save the directory file location as a text input so that the system will know upon launch what to load. The problem is that I am currently having to use an external file to let the system know what to load, but this won't work as I will have to hardcode the system to look for the first file to load the rest. What is a module that can save/cache the directory text so that I never have to save an external file. Also needing it to save the information even when I exit the program. Is there anyway to do this?"
132,1547061000.8231,Shan,```Currently I am having to have my system save the directory file location as a text input so that the system will know upon launch what to load.``` elaborate further plz
133,1547062229.8268,Nenita,"alright. Ill do my best; to be specific.; I have designed and pretty much finished a point system for the company i work with. all the information is stored in a dataframe which is then saved as a pickle file so employees cannot edit the information (although they wouldnt know how necessarily). Everything saves and loads just fine, but knowing I will be putting this on currently 8 company computers, I don't want to have to hardcode the save location everytime for the pickle file. So I made a simple entry for the saved/loaded pickle file. The problem is that it is impossible at the moment for the program, upon launch, to know what to load without hardcoding it."
134,1547062609.8299,Jettie,it can look in the same directory the program is in
133,1547062629.8305,Jettie,"this way the directory itself may be different on different computers, but the file will still be easily found"
135,1547065905.8325,Candi,Hello guys I cannot make out difference between input and raw_input is it python version specific thing?
135,1547065956.8329,Sasha,It is. They changed the behavior between 2 and 3.
135,1547066015.8338,Candi,so it is same for python 3 or only input() exists now
135,1547066145.8346,Sasha,"`input()` in 3 does what `raw_input()` used to do in 2, and there's no separate `raw_input()` any more.; Basically they concluded that the old `input()`, which evaluated the data as a Python expression, was just a bad idea."
135,1547067316.8362,Nenita,sorry for the late response. was in a meeting.; <@Jettie> you are my hero
135,1547068723.8371,Candi,<@Sasha> got it thank you

136,1547080770.8407,Maricruz,"<@Bethany> will do. i've definitely spent an hour or two in the past trying to fix that issue with `tqdm` on linux and nothing. which is a shame cuz `tqdm` is really easy, looks good, etc.; <@Bethany> think it has something to do with this line in `_tqdm.py` and the `\r` not working on linux? or something?

Looking for tools that allows me to browse the schema/tables/rows.  Ideally something free.  I'm on Win10 and I've created an ODBC connection and I've used that in Access to do a little of what I'm trying to do, but was hoping for a tool that would let me dive a bit deeper into the schema, maybe filter out empty tables (or at least report which ones are) and have a few more tools for dev?"

145,1547109225.8723,Jung,"Hello everyone.
Do you know why some projects to use tox?
I'm a newbie and not understand why need tox and why not use simple virtual environment."
144,1547109383.8726,Jimmy,tox is used so you can test in multiple environment
145,1547109400.8732,Jung,"2.7, 3.5, etc?"
145,1547109408.8735,Jimmy,"for example if you develop a library that support python &gt;3.5 you want to run tests on 3.5, 3.6, 3.7"
145,1547109567.8739,Jung,"Ok. And how to contributing to a library for this case?
For example, I see on Github library for python 2.7 and 3.6
I want to fix the code.
What I need first?
To create a virtual environment with 2.7, second v.e. with 3.6?
Or not?"
145,1547109713.8745,Jimmy,I think in that case I would work in a 2.7 environment; and use tox to tests other version
145,1547110189.8753,Jung,"Ok. Now I need to understand how to run tests for a different version using tox.
Thanks! <@Jimmy> :taco:"
144,1547110202.8755,Jimmy,that's what tox does
145,1547110231.876,Jimmy,it automagically creates a virtual env for all thoses versions and run tests in those
145,1547110652.8762,Jung,"It's easy.
If I right understand

```
tox -e py27
```
Run all tests for Python 2.7

```
tox
```
Run all tests for all versions.

```
tox -e py27 name_folder/model_test.py
```
Run tests only from this file.
Right? <@Jimmy>"
145,1547110834.8764,Jimmy,:thumbsup:
145,1547112189.8771,Jung,"Sorry. But still, I not understand one moment.
For example,
I create a test for python2.7 and I want to create a test for this part of code for Python3.7
We know 2.7 and 3.7 different, and code for py2.7 can not work in 3.7
How to resolve this problem with tox? And with pytest?; ```
import sys
@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info &lt; (3,6),
                    reason=""requires python3.6 or higher"")
def test_function():
    ...
```
I think this to resolve my problem."
146,1547112733.8786,Jettie,"of course it can, otherwise how would people use your program with different python versions at all?; it's possible to support 2.7 and 3.x in one code base"
145,1547113421.8795,Jung,"Leonid, I'm right to understand how to write tests and run it with different python versions?
```
@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info == (2,7))
```
For example, so to write tests.
and then run `tox -e py36`
Right?"

149,1547126407.8857,Ardath,What's up guys. Could do with some advice; None; I hope the code snippet makes sense; Basically trying to build a query via mongoengine; Each value of the keys in `args` are passed into the `Q` object; But i need an `&amp;` separator in between each group of `Q`'s
149,1547126831.889,Keva,hey guys :slightly_smiling_face:; None; what-the-hell :confused:; it's confusing; is there some proper way to check for type of value at given dictionary key?; could somebody help me out please?
149,1547127026.8911,Jimmy,`type(jp.data['additional_info']) is dict`
149,1547127118.8913,Keva,thank you! :slightly_smiling_face:
149,1547129305.8979,Ashley,"For a more detailed explanation, <@Keva>, in Python, `is` is the same thing as `===` in other languages. Instead of just checking equal value of the two objects, it checks that they are literally the same object. So if you say `jp.data['additional_info'] is dict`, you're asking if `jp.data['additional_data']` is literally _the_ `dict` class. But an instance of a class is not the same object as the class itself"
150,1547129477.8996,Yaeko,"Adding to this, using `is` for short strings or low ints is not good unless you know what you are doing. Since Python caches (correct term?) these object two short strings will point to the same object and therefore will be identical using `is` while two long strings will not be cached and not be identical with `is` even though they might be the same string.; if the rambling makes any sense"
150,1547129819.9004,Ardath,Think I found a solution using the mongoengine `__raw__` query param; None
150,1547130329.9064,Clemmie,"<@Sallie> it looks like no one answered your question. method overloading (including constructors) is not supported in python. That said, default values lets you do pretty much the same thing, as overloading is almost always used to allow for various sets of defaults. In your case it looks like you want
```
def __init__(self, name=""Mike"", age=29):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
```
Any values provided when the constructor is called will be used, but if it is missing the default is used. you could call this in the following ways
```
&gt; t = Test()
&lt;name ""Mike"" , age 29&gt;

&gt; t = Test(name=""Bob"")
&lt;name ""Bob"" , age 29&gt;

&gt; t = Test(age = 17)
&lt;name ""Mike"" , age 17&gt;

&gt; t = Test(name=""Bob"", age=17)
&lt;name ""Bob"" , age  17&gt;
```"
149,1547130357.9067,Keva,thank you <@Yaeko> <@Ashley>
150,1547130465.9071,Sallie,Thanks for your support :slightly_smiling_face:
149,1547130528.9076,Keva,guess i just should use isinstance()
150,1547130875.91,Ouida,"<@Keva> just saying, that in Python, usually, you should aim for what's called *duck typing*.
&gt; if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it's probably a duck
in other words, you should usually just try to do what you are trying to do, and if you think that there are other possibilities, just use `try-catch` and handle other cases. if you have too many different cases, and something can have multiple different behaviors, your design might be flawed."
151,1547130951.911,Clemmie,<@Jimmy> is there a sir_botalot integration for reminding that tacos are the coin of the realm?
149,1547130996.9113,Lydia,Just a note... The folks over at Instagram are trying to do away with  duck typing because it becomes unmaintainable over time when  trying to evaluate what a function return should do
151,1547131092.9121,Jimmy,there is not. If you have a good idea for one we can add that
151,1547131131.9134,Lydia,Anyone have a working set of code that opens a RotatingFileHandler log but also allows me to add the stderr and stdout streams to that file handler?
151,1547131137.9136,Clemmie,"Not really, I have to dig into sir-bot-a-lot. Does it scan for keywords, or is it user triggered, or something else?"
151,1547131183.9141,Jimmy,it regex on the messages and also support `/` commands. so both
151,1547131195.9142,Clemmie,"Can you elaborate or link to a discussion? That sound like something to handle with mypy, duck typing is pretty pythonic; ok, cool. Will take a look"
151,1547131210.9147,Ouida,"I'm referring mainly to using `isinstance` or otherwise conditioning on the object *type*. if you find yourself having to add multiple `if isinstance(obj, some_type)` excessively so it becomes unmaintainable, you have other problems. that's also hard to follow.
I haven't read any article they released about this topic (if you have one handy I would be happy to) but I'm guessing that in general they would try to avoid it when appropriate but not by using `isinstance`, but maybe modifying design.; <@Clemmie> but could also be rather unreadable... I try to avoid but structuring my code properly. try :slightly_smiling_face:"
151,1547131325.9154,Clemmie,"Oh, sure, ok."

151,1547131605.9166,Lydia,"The idea around it is that I shouldn't have to see what you are going to do with your return or even care enough to read through the many iterations of what your function could return.; It should be uniform and the same when it comes out at the end; just because you say duckBuilder doesn't mean you are guaranteeing duckCount int type as a return, or even duckName attribute as the return."
151,1547131773.917,Keva,whats the difference between type hinting (avaiable since python 3.6) and mypy?; syntax is the same.
151,1547131839.9174,Ouida,"<@Lydia> *of course!!!* and that's what I said. you should avoid duck typing if you know what to expect. but if more than one kind of object is expected, duck typing is the pythonic way.; and thanks for the links!"
151,1547131883.9181,Lydia,TBH I wasn't aware of it and came across it one night when I was looking at someone else's code on Github so thought I'd share the love.
151,1547131886.9183,Ouida,"<@Keva> mypy is the tool for running static analysis on your *typed* code; the type-hinting, which is part of the standard since 3.5, is just the type annotations (which you can reference in runtime if you really want to).
type-hinting is also available in earlier versions, but as comments, that `mypy` and even IDEs like PyCharm can understand.; we use type-hinting wherever possible with Py2 and it helps a lot when working inside PyCharm because it provides intellisense based on these types."

151,1547132387.9198,Bethany,I can imagine a few cases where the behavior is desired. Never actually used the decorator myself; tbh I'm not sure why you would do that over something like the following
151,1547132449.9202,Ouida,it wasn't ideal in C++ (template specialization - which most people aren't even aware of probably) and it isn't ideal now :slightly_smiling_face:
151,1547132518.9204,Bethany,I mostly see it for something like the following; None
151,1547132591.921,Ouida,"for dispatching you can always like: ```
disp = {
    dict: func_on_dict,
    list: func_on_list
}

def default_handler(obj, ...): pass

def dispatch(obj, *args, **kwargs):
    return disp.get(type(obj), default_handler)(*args, **kwargs)```; yeah - not the end of the world, but still better than actually using `isinstance`.

161,1547161518.0015,Erich,"Hey y'all; I'm trying to figure out how to make a package I wrote installable, so that a user can just install it and use it. Not trying to distribute it to PyPI, it's for internal use at my company. The issue I'm having is that the package requires some user input for configuration that I need to store somewhere; currently they just get stored in a `config.ini` file in the package directory. I could of course have a script that generates this config file that they have to run before they install the package, and then the config file gets installed with the package, but that doesn't seem like the best solution. Any ideas?"

There doesn't seem to be any option or section of the toml file or anything that relates to saving private user info.

161,1547164968.0096,Shan,"If a program requires a config file to work properly, you should either provide a default one or build in functionality to create one with something like `$program init` which then prompts for input of various things. It should save to the current directory, a project directory, or within the homedir.  You would define that requirement."

161,1547166179.0175,Erich,I think this is fine; I'll create a `__main__.py` file which will start the CLI for generating the config.

Are you wanting to add the contents of `alphabet` onto each letter `i`, or the other way around? It seems that you are wanting to instead add each new letter `i` to `alphabet`.

If you are not yet familiar with the `set` data type, read section 5.4 on this link. It’s a way that you can shorten your function.
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets>"
175,1547268520.0945,Demetrice,"I think i see what you're saying. So instead my if function should just test to see if i is a in the alphabet. And i was wanting to add i to alphabet if it wasn't already in there. So now i have this. It's still failing but hopefully i'm closer to the right idea now.                                                                            def is_pangram(sentence):

187,1547406664.1292,Jamey,Hi all. I have a problem. I am trying to model users in my application and only one kind of user has a relationship with a model called `Department`. Basically the user in question belongs to a department but other users of the application don't need to have a relationship with a department.; How do I model the different users? Should I have a different model for each kind of user or is there a way to model this while using one `User` model?
187,1547406877.1302,Yvette,i would create other model to that kind of user extending the existing one; if not you will need to add lot of fields to the User model for each special case; so the User model would become untidy and big; (IMHO)
187,1547407351.1331,Jamey,Hmmm... True. That's what I'm going to do but the problem that Django creates tables for the base `User` model as well as the extensions of the `User` model which seems a little untidy to me.

193,1547479081.162,Ashley,"<@Rodrick> it’s recommended that you use a virtual environment. You can install python 2.7 normally, and then create a virtual environment that clones your python 2.7 executable. It will become its own environment with its own set of installed packages, and its own `pip` that will install to that environment. Then you can just activate that env whenever you want to work in it"

198,1547497097.2229,Bethany,rule of thumb is only pip install after all packages you need from conda are installed.
198,1547497138.2234,Shan,i _think_ i know why but can you elaborate?
198,1547497159.224,Bethany,It's best to think of `conda` as a replacement for `yum` or `apt` instead of pip i think; plus `venv`
198,1547497182.2245,Cathrine,Oh ok
198,1547497201.2254,Bethany,"As you may have guessed, I've messed this up countless times myself"
198,1547497209.2258,Hiroko,:smile:; this does sound like something that its easy to burn yourself
198,1547497240.2267,Shan,it does
198,1547497265.2277,Cathrine,Pip instead of conda is there another app I can use? That easily supports “pip freeze”
198,1547497277.2281,Shan,lets back up a bit.; why are you wanting to use `conda`?
198,1547497287.2288,Bethany,yeah. Why are you using conda in the first place
198,1547497316.2294,Cathrine,I thought it was easier 
198,1547497337.2299,Bethany,it doesn't look like your using libraries with C-extensions and hte like. I'd just use pip for this
198,1547497353.2301,Shan,why did you think it was easier?; lets help you select the right tools
198,1547497397.2312,Cathrine,Yes please
198,1547497432.2319,Bethany,"I use conda for scientific computing and data science stuff. It's great for libraries with C dependencies, which is common in those fields. If you don't need it I think it's a bit more difficult to deal with than say pip + venv"
198,1547497471.2326,Shan,are you also using conda so that you can specify specific python versions?
198,1547497476.2329,Bethany,yeah
198,1547497483.2333,Cathrine,Yes
198,1547497492.234,Shan,check out `pyenv` to manage your python versions.
198,1547497500.2346,Bethany,it does a lot. I actually wish the community would stop making extra managers and just make conda better; most of what they do is already in that tool
198,1547497533.2356,Cathrine,Because virtualenv uses python2.7 as default 
198,1547497536.2358,Shan,"unsure, ive never felt compelled to use it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
198,1547497548.2368,Cathrine,And I’ve tried changing that but no luck too
198,1547497556.2372,Hiroko,"incorrect, <@Cathrine> venv uses whatever python version you specify; sounds like you started the venv incorrectly"
198,1547497589.2384,Bethany,do people use `pyenv` to manage multiple pythons if you don't have conda?
198,1547497599.2386,Shan,i do
198,1547497619.2391,Hiroko,I use docker mostly; so no; but I can understand the use case
198,1547497635.2401,Bethany,yeah now i prefer to just do docker + miniconda; docker makes the environment stuff irrelevant
198,1547497673.2408,Shan,i use `pyenv` with `direnv`.
198,1547497686.2412,Cathrine,None
198,1547497700.2418,Shan,"eh, im resource strapped.  spinning up docker containers outside of what i have to run is rough. :disappointed:; what is that image?"
198,1547497725.2427,Cathrine,Which do I use?
198,1547497731.243,Shan,can you paste text rather than pictures
198,1547497740.2433,Cathrine,Oh right ; Sorry; That is the result for using virtualenv ; It always comes out as python2.7
198,1547497781.2448,Hiroko,what command do you use to start the virtualenv?
198,1547497791.2452,Cathrine,In the bin file
198,1547497795.2455,Hiroko,"no, no; sorry, what command do you use to _create_ the venv?"
198,1547497805.2462,Cathrine,How do I change it?
198,1547497807.2464,Clint,Have you installed the newest python 3 version?
198,1547497816.2469,Shan,too many questions.
198,1547497862.2478,Clint,"I prefer to use pipenv for my environments, and it is very simple to use. Just a suggestion."
198,1547497877.2482,Cathrine,Yes
198,1547497885.2486,Shan,`yes` what?
198,1547497885.2487,Hiroko,"<@Cathrine> sounds like python 2.7 is the default when you do `which python`; try same venv creation with `python3 ....`; note this:

```jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  which python
/usr/local/bin/python
jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  python -V
Python 2.7.14
jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  python3 -V
Python 3.6.5
jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
```; system python is 2.7.14; specifying `python3` gets the py3 version installed"
198,1547498087.2532,Shan,"so you could do, `python3 -m venv .venv` and it will create a virtualenv inside of your current directory in a dir called `.venv`"
198,1547498089.2535,Cathrine,"<@Hiroko> yes but it still shows me packages from my main system, when I do the “pip freeze” which was my initial question "
198,1547498119.2545,Hiroko,"again, that’s probably because you’re creating the venv with python2; _not_ 3"
198,1547498133.2555,Cathrine,<@Shan> oh ok
198,1547498140.256,Hiroko,_and_ not specifying the path to the python interpreter you want to use
198,1547498142.2561,Shan,"starting from scratch.
```
- remove current virtualenv
- move to the project dir
- `python3 -m venv .venv`
- `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
```"
198,1547498167.2572,Cathrine,Ok what should my first line of code look like?; <@Shan> ok
198,1547498313.2603,Clint,"If you are trying to create an environment that does not bring in the current systems packages, just avoid using freeze. I would recommend installing pipenv with pip, (newer versions of python3 comes with pip pre installed) run pipenv install in the folder you want to create your new environment, and that will give you an empty pip file and pipfile.lock, which you can then add packages to through pipenv install ""desired package name here"""
198,1547498344.2613,Shan,lets get him going with the basics first <@Clint>
198,1547498344.2614,Clint,very clean and simple
198,1547498362.2618,Shan,"also, `pipenv` isnt stable.  they are continually releasing breaking changes.; its a _neat toy_"
198,1547498391.2623,Clint,"I have not had any real issues with it; but fair point, I just consider it the easiest way to introduce some one to a virtual environment as it does not need much set up. but you are correct that going through the basics first is probably the better plan"
198,1547498567.2646,Cathrine,"Thanks guys, very helpful; I’ll try these steps and give updates "
201,1547502365.2658,Nenita,how would you iterate through a list to return the index number and value?
201,1547502390.2662,Hiroko,"`enumerate`; `for idx, val in enumerate(some_list):`"
201,1547502502.2672,Nenita,"that what i did, but i figured out it helps if you use the correct list lol; thanks anyways. good to know i was on the right track."

212,1547557666.3154,Fidelia,"hi all,; just a generic question, do we need to collect cookies and what are they used for?"
212,1547558090.3192,Ashley,"<@Fidelia> that’s a big question, and really depends on the context. Normally, no, you don’t want to be collecting cookies. The browser only sends the cookies to the server that share the same domain and sub-domain as the server they’d be sent to, and the JS on the site only has access to the cookies according to the same restriction. So usually, you only have access to the cookies you would already know about, so there’d be no point in collecting them; things get more complicated with embedded content though"
212,1547558142.32,Fidelia,oh ok what is the use of embeded content?

212,1547558347.3224,Fidelia,yes <@Ashley>
212,1547558383.323,Ashley,"well, those like buttons are actually embedded content and is inside an iframe pointing to facebook. When you see that like button, it means you’re connecting to FB, and they give you a cookie so they can find out every time you visit a site that has one of their like buttons on it; the FB servers know which like button you are seeing and what page it was embedded to; so even if you aren’t logged into FB, or don’t even have a FB account, they can still give you a cookie, and start tracking what pages you go to; they aren’t really collecting the cookie itself; but they are using the cookie they gave you to track where you went on the internet; the same is true for other like buttons, e.g. google plus, pinterest, etc"
212,1547558507.3262,Fidelia,oh so that can be routed to what type of similar ads they can display on to your wall?; what other use of this way of embedded content ?; ?
212,1547558762.3281,Ashley,"the only other use would be encouraging user engagement with the platform, and enabling social media addiction by constantly having its presence everywhere"
212,1547558805.3293,Fidelia,"oh, so you will have retention rate of existing users"
212,1547558810.3294,Ashley,they mostly just want data on people that they can run analyses on and sell to others; yes
212,1547558820.3298,Fidelia,oh; but that is ok to collect that large amount of data?
212,1547558857.3305,Ashley,depends on who you ask haha; most tech-literate people condemn it; they are not ok with it; and many non-tech-literate people also don’t like being watched everywhere they go
212,1547558908.3322,Hiroko,"if you do try to do it, you will get a bad reputation"
212,1547558924.3329,Ashley,but that’s how big companies like google and FB make a lot of their money
212,1547558928.3331,Hiroko,"busineses would want to work with you, sure.  but your personal relationships would suffer"
212,1547558942.3336,Ashley,^
212,1547558945.3338,Hiroko,I know several people who have lost close friendships after working similar projects at FB/Amazon
212,1547558956.3343,Ashley,same
212,1547558976.335,Hiroko,"it was worth it for them professionally, but wouldn’t want to hang out with them in any context more than limited acquantianceship"
212,1547558981.3353,Ashley,this is actually a _very_ hot topic at the moment
212,1547558984.3355,Hiroko,lost a great deal of respect for them
212,1547558999.3357,Ashley,"yeah; I also know some who got dragged into it unexpectedly; they worked in different areas, and then got reassigned to those things; they tried to get out quickly though, which was good; for what it’s worth, there _are_ ethical ways of doing data analysis on large groups of people. They’re just much more difficult, take longer, and aren’t as profitable"
212,1547559120.3382,Fidelia,oh sorry to hear that of losing close relationships.; yeah i guess the ethics play a major part of it
212,1547559163.3389,Hiroko,"ethics also depend on prioritization; if a company prioritizes them, thats one thing; but for the most part, they’re inconvenient"
212,1547559263.3404,Fidelia,accepted as they want to balance and make more profits as their primary aim is to sustain and make their VCs happy.; hope that was correct :slightly_smiling_face:
213,1547560939.342,Bethany,I've heard some interesting ideas in these areas. There are moves to make anonymous data acquisition make sense for analysis but it's immature and slow; Maybe that would make it less bad
213,1547561025.3427,Ashley,"depends on how it’s anonymized; there’s a lot you can do to de-anonymize data if it isn’t handled carefully, and a lot of it depends on context, and other sources of data"
213,1547561129.344,Bethany,They're using <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption>; So you can do analysis without actually being able to see the data
213,1547561162.3448,Ashley,"ah, yeah, that would be helpful"
213,1547561177.3453,Bethany,And get statistical results without individual ones; I think it helps lessen the privacy invasion thing but maybe you're still treating people as commodity and that's bad enough
213,1547561260.3471,Karoline,"This is a big focus at Apple because they see user privacy as a market differentiator, but these days you can't get away from needing user data."
213,1547561351.3491,Bethany,"I know it's gonna be huge in regulated spaces, like medical. Gather anonymous data on many people and return a diagnosis or something, and the person doing the computation literally can't see data or even the result"
213,1547561574.3501,Fidelia,yes medical is really tough to get into. They have very well and good regulations.

214,1547563705.3566,Jimmy,I never used panda some can't really help you but if I understand correctly you have a bunch of list and you want a 2 column dataframe ? That sounds like something it should be able to do
214,1547563737.3569,Conchita,"Yes, exactly what I want!"
214,1547563894.3572,Jimmy,looks like <http://pbpython.com/pandas-list-dict.html> can help you
214,1547564318.3597,Conchita,"Thanks, nice find. I tried some of the methods listed here and it illuminated another issue I think I need to solve first. ```AssertionError: 2 columns passed, passed data had 34 columns
```
Seems my data is messed up at an earlier point as my lists have 34 columns..; I'll try to sort that out first!; Thansk for the link!"
215,1547564462.3609,Jimmy,"no problem, good luck"
214,1547564580.362,Clemmie,"<@Conchita> I’m guessing that you passed it 34 - 2 column lists. Pandas is nice, but it can be a little tricky getting it into the structure you need"
214,1547564695.363,Conchita,"That could be. Do you have any suggestion for how to chop it from 34 -&gt; 2 columns?; This is code is of ""get it done"" quality, I know it's a bit of a mess hehe. I suspect the 34 columns were created on line 28 with `y = self.address, t.to_string(header=None, index=False)`; The reason for line 28 is that I wanted to get only the value, and not pandas dtype information"
214,1547565071.366,Clemmie,"I think from lines 31 - 36 replace with:
```
data = [[],[]]
for i,j in y:
   data[0].append(i)
   data[1].append(j)
```; That way you end up with data, which is 2 lists, the first with addresses, the second with t.to_string()’s"
214,1547565256.3675,Conchita,"I suspect for the same issue (too many columns), I receive this error ```ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)```"
214,1547565513.369,Clemmie,"Looking at the docs that <@Jimmy> pointed out, it looks like your first way should have worked. can you add a print(data) prior to creating the dataframe to see how it is structured?"
214,1547565670.3691,Conchita,None
214,1547565754.3701,Clemmie,And that is `print(data)`? I would expect it to be in wrapping square brackets; Also for the elements in y to be tuples; hmmm
214,1547565847.3719,Conchita,"I used `return data`, where the method call printed it. When using `print(data)` inside the method, I get ```['357R3FeNmySYeHuRfyhFd6nMwzoLDdjfwV', '7377.0']

214,1547565913.3725,Jimmy,I think there is a misunderstanding :slightly_smiling_face: can you paste a bigger part of your code
214,1547565923.3727,Conchita,Yes hold on :slightly_smiling_face:; This is almost the same as I posted above here (just added the print statement)
214,1547566125.3743,Clemmie,"Well a few things jump out with the print result you just showed. Obviously the `None`s but also if you are appending to a list I would expect the whole thing to be wrapped in `[]`; That `header=None` can you lookup if there is an option for header=False. I think those `None`s might actually _be_ the header; Also, do those results look like `address/t.to_string()` pairs? (ie. `['3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64', '108135.0']` looks correct?; Yup, looking at the pandas to_string def, I think you want `headers=False`
```
header : bool, optional
Write out the column names. If a list of strings is given, it is assumed to be aliases for the column names
```

214,1547566893.3774,Conchita,"Sorry got hit with a powercut here, looking into it now; The results are correct; I did modify so `headers=False`, same result"
214,1547567087.3784,Clemmie,"You got those `None`s still?; I’m officially confused. The first element in each y (so in each list of your output) is `self.address` That value is not changed anywhere in the code, just set up in `__init__`, but you are seeing different values in your output."
214,1547567267.3802,Conchita,"Yes, still get them; Well, correct until ""but you are seeing different values in your output."". As an example `self.address` = '357R3FeNmySYeHuRfyhFd6nMwzoLDdjfwV'; So the address value is correctly passed / returned; Oh sorry"
214,1547567470.3835,Clemmie,"Right, but from the code you are showing those 6 lists are all populated between lines 32 and 33. All inside a single instance of Crystal which only has one self.address"
214,1547567480.3837,Conchita,"I switch between these two and mixed it up here, that's the reason for your confusion

214,1547567518.3845,Clemmie,"Same here; <@Conchita> what happens when you run the original code you showed, with just one address?"
214,1547567678.3859,Conchita,"When I run the original code I pasted above, with only one address I get ```AssertionError: 2 columns passed, passed data had 34 columns```; If I add `print(data)` into that code I get ```['16ftSEQ4ctQFDtVZiUBusQUjRrGhM3JYwe', '20000.0']

217,1547569910.4023,Nenita,Is there a shorter way for typing this out?
217,1547570061.4027,Jimmy,`itertools` probably :smile:; <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable>; or just regular `itertools.chain`
218,1547577049.4055,Nenita,"Anyone knowledgeable on adding sheets to an excel file using pandas? This code ends up overwriting the entire workbook or sheet. (one or the other, I only had 1 sheet in the workbook to begin with). Some examples as shown here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42370977/how-to-save-a-new-sheet-in-an-existing-excel-file-using-pandas/42371251> look similar to what I have and I am not sure how it is different in the form of telling it to add sheets rather than overwrite them."
218,1547577290.4064,Bethany,"<@Olevia> it sounds like you mean divergent and convergent in the context of a mathematical series, is that right?; As in, a convergent series is one where limit of x -&gt; infinity is well defined"
218,1547577390.4079,Olevia,<@Bethany> yes !
218,1547577469.409,Bethany,can you show one example?
218,1547577553.4096,Olevia,A divergent series like sum(1/n) and a convergent series like sum(1/n^2)
218,1547577744.4097,Marth,"from the link, it looks as though as long as you use a unique sheet_name each time, it'll create different sheets.  Does it not?"
218,1547578466.41,Nenita,"I am not using excelwriter so in the form of my example, no, it just overwrites the entire workbook. I created 3 blank sheets and wrote to a sheet ""qb results"". it removed all 3 sheets and then wrote in qb results.; but from those examples, the line ""to_excel('attributes here')"" there is not much difference so im thinking excelwriter with openpyxl tells it to add or overwrite a sheet"
218,1547578651.4113,Sasha,"Normally you wouldn't be able to make convergence determinations from a finite list of numbers, since you need the behavior out to infinity. What finite property are you trying to assess?"
218,1547578713.4117,Olevia,"That's the problem; If i want to iterate n time on a method to see if it's convergent or divergent, i dont know how to handle this with python"
218,1547578867.4147,Sasha,"It's basically impossible. You could have a method which outputs ""1, 1, 1, 1, 1"" for a trillion places, and then suddenly switches to an exponential function.; What problem are you really trying to solve?"
218,1547578982.4165,Olevia,I just want to put a serie as à parameter for a method who can tell me if the serie is divergent or convergent
218,1547579009.417,Sasha,"Do you have the formula for the series, or do you need to treat it as a black box of outputs?"
218,1547579110.4176,Olevia,The objective is to put any formula; And enter the n time to Check
218,1547579197.4192,Marth,So I tested trying the following:
218,1547579213.4196,Sasha,"Can you explain how ""n"" matters? Do you want the behavior at infinity, or are you looking for some finite property like ""function is still growing at n""?"
218,1547579236.4198,Marth,"`import pandas as pd

218,1547579346.423,Olevia,Normaly you can test a serie just by trying to find in what n the serie is divergent/convergent
218,1547579369.4233,Nenita,so im assuming i have to use excelwriter?
218,1547579370.4235,Marth,so it looks like you have to use a writer object to write without overwriting? and then you save at the end; looks like it
218,1547579408.4245,Nenita,"well thanks for the help. you didn't have to go that far, but awesome I now know this. Thanks again."
218,1547579417.4249,Sasha,"At any finite n, you can calculate sum(1/n), and it's just a number. Its divergence is only a property at infinity. How would your program use n for this?"

218,1547579589.427,Marth,"yeah, I've been doing a fair amount of csv &lt;--&gt; python/pandas &lt;--&gt; Excel"
218,1547579591.4272,Olevia,Like 1/1+1/2+1/3+...+1/n
218,1547579592.4273,Marth,good times :slightly_smiling_face:
218,1547579718.4282,Sasha,"(Sorry, I need to leave. I don't think we're communicating very well for some reason. Good luck...)"
218,1547579784.4295,Olevia,Yeah i see what you tried to ask me
218,1547579787.4297,Clemmie,"<@Olevia> do you have a link to a mathematical formulation that exlpains how what you are trying to do is possible?; Or are you trying to code up an algorithm for analyzing if a series has a limit?; If the latter use SymPy <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/series/limitseq.html>; for reference, I found that by googling “python calculate the limit of a series”"
218,1547580180.4332,Olevia,"For the moment i need to check if a series is convergente or divergent, then i will check the series has a limit"
218,1547580182.4334,Bethany,Yeah what Ed is saying is true. Any finite series has infinitely many patterns that could explain it; Is this for homework?
218,1547580214.4339,Olevia,"Yes; I've searched for some idea or code sample, i found nothing about that; this link explain this using maths : <http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/ConvergenceOfSeries.aspx>"
218,1547580358.4371,Clemmie,"Wait, if this is for homework shouldn’t you be coding the algorithm?; Basically implementing what you read in that link? (Which I have not read, just glanced at)"
218,1547580478.4396,Briana,"I am having a challenge finding information on turning the stdout of a command from subprocess into a dict. Can anyone point me in the direction I need to look please? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Here is the output
```
HOST1
    data1 = 0
    data2 = 10
    data3 = 694d7302424e69627fb6b0dedf9b362c01c6b597
    data4 = 234910

    data2 = 23
    data3 = 7219a50894aede1c48f4a2f888dd57dda9d89230
    data4 = 29459019324
    data5 = string.host2.name
```

I am trying to turn the above data into this

`host1_dict = {'data1':'0','data2':'10','data3':'694d7302424e69627fb6b0dedf9b362c01c6b597','data4':'234910','data5':'string.host1.name'}`


`host2_dict = {'data1':'12','data2':'23','data3':'7219a50894aede1c48f4a2f888dd57dda9d89230','data4':'29459019324','data5':'string.host2.name'}`"
218,1547580526.4409,Bethany,Though a less precise and possible approach could be to check the difference between consecutive terms. If the difference approaches zero it's a hint that it's converging
218,1547580610.4418,Kiera,<@Briana> are you asking about how to capture the stdout from subprocess or how to manipulate the captured string to create the dictionary you're looking for?
218,1547580649.4425,Briana,Trying to manipulate the str variable that was created in the stdout captured from the command
219,1547580917.4443,Kiera,"this seems fairly straightforward.  First. split the output around newlines, to create a list of lines.  Then loop through each line.  If the line begins with `HOST`, then that tells you which dictionary you're working on.  Otherwise, split the line around `=`; as long as it has 2 fields, strip each field of leading and trailing whitespace and add the resulting key and value into the dictionary you're working on."
218,1547580978.4449,Olevia,"That's the first idea i tried, but some serie are annoying like 1/n+10000000"
218,1547581013.4457,Bethany,Is this a math or programming class
218,1547581023.4461,Olevia,programming; I'm very interested about python but i admit that this problem is very strange
218,1547581054.4469,Bethany,Do they say to write a program or to do it by hand?
218,1547581087.4477,Briana,"ok, how do I handle HOST1 and HOST2 to make them my new dict starter. These are random hostnames `stupid.host.name` and `idiot.has.no.naming.scheme` are the sections I am looking for. Once I split this, I do I key off of these 2 items to make them the dict name once I split."
218,1547581095.4478,Olevia,Write a program that can show if the series is divergent or convergent; any series**
219,1547581102.4483,Kiera,what do you mean?
218,1547581113.4484,Bethany,"This is an odd thing to program, unless you're writing a symbolic algebra software; Can yo you paste the question in its entirety?"
218,1547581198.4508,Olevia,Yes
218,1547581251.4528,Briana,the data sections of the output are fairly consistent. the header of the output is the actual hostname of one of the connected machines I am pulling the data from. My final output is going to be converting these and outputting the data to a json that is unique for that host containing the data.
218,1547581251.4529,Olevia,But i'm not sure that they want us to write symbolic algebra
218,1547581263.4534,Bethany,I doubt it; Which is why I want to see the whole question exactly as written
218,1547581288.4545,Briana,I am trying to figure out how to split the sections into seperate hosts. On a single run there will be around 1000 of those blocks
218,1547581290.4546,Bethany,We may be missing some info
218,1547581300.4548,Kiera,"The easiest way might be to have a ""parent"" dictionary that holds the host dictionaries, keyed off the `HOST` line itself.  That way, as you're looping through, when you find a line that begins with a non-space character, just add that line to the ""parent"" dictionary as the key with a value of a blank dictionary; record either the key, so that subsequent data lines can be added as `parent_dict[host_key][data_key] = data_value`, or record the dictionary itself (`host_dict = {}` // `parent_dict[host_key] = host_dict`) so that subsequent data lines can be added directly into the host dictionary: `host_dict[data_key] = data_value`"
218,1547581321.4551,Briana,ok makes sense
218,1547581344.4557,Olevia,"Program a program in python language to determine if the sequence is convergent, divergent or has no limits."
218,1547581357.4561,Kiera,"this way you'll end up with
```
{
     'HOST1': {
        'data1': '0',
        'data2': '10',
        # …
    },
    'HOST2': {
        # …
    },
}
```"
218,1547581374.4562,Olevia,And the user must be able to put is own sequence
218,1547581402.4568,Bethany,That's it? I'm surprised
218,1547581405.457,Olevia,I've only that
218,1547581406.4573,Kiera,"although, if you're only looking for information about a single host, it _might_ be more efficient to look for that hostname first, then just process that one data block."
218,1547581446.4582,Olevia,"A bit hard when you know that i've never used python before that, but it's a very good langage"
218,1547581458.4587,Kiera,"it depends on whether or not you need to access other hosts later, or otherwise keep accessing or manipulating the overall data set."
218,1547581504.4594,Briana,"The data will pull in the output for 1000 hosts. process them into a json, submit the jsons to an api, then quit.; no retention will be required, just simply being able to build the array from the dict; I don't use all the datapoint. in the end there are actually about 30 for each host, I am going to be pulling 7"
218,1547581592.4605,Bethany,it's odd since those terms only have meaning for infinite sequences; and a user can't input an infinite sequence
218,1547581622.4613,Briana,I appreciate your assistance <@Kiera>
218,1547581921.4616,Olevia,That's why we can set the n time we want to check the sequence
218,1547581946.4618,Bethany,"how is the sequence input?; like is the input a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, ...]`; or is it a mathematical function like `x[n] = 1/n`; apparently if you really want to get pendantic, every finite sequence converges <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/600795/can-a-sequence-be-called-convergent-divergent-if-it-has-finite-number-of-terms>"
218,1547582646.4627,Olevia,"I've tried with a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, ...], it's easier, but i think if i want to do a very good function, it should be a mathematical function; I think i will see if it's possible to use finite sequence, it would be much easier to try to develop"
218,1547582860.4631,Bethany,"yes, it's just fundamentally invalid :stuck_out_tongue:; i think that is closer to what they are looking for though"
218,1547582904.4636,Olevia,Thank you for your help <@Bethany> ! That's very appreciate
218,1547583282.4642,Nikki,Anyone know of an API which will take screen grabs of webpages?
220,1547584119.4648,Shan,"Define, screen grabs.; Salenium might be your best bet."
220,1547584419.4656,Nikki,"Yea, I thought that - as in screenshot"

221,1547585808.4705,Hiroko,what version requests are you using?; and sounds like whatever server you’re querying isn’t returning the correct content-type

232,1547640988.5659,Jimmy,<@Wilhelmina> virtualenv and pyenv are used together. There are not exclusive; pyenv is used to install other python version; you can then create virtualenv for your project with a different version of python; oups I missed <@Mica> answer :smile:

234,1547661160.5802,Nenita,nope. generated straight from Lowe's website. That's the layout for Lowe's statements.; well the separator is somewhat merging the row data.; this doesn't iterate through the row rather it just prints the entire row.
234,1547661380.5815,Sasha,"You may have to preprocess the data to get it into consistent CSV format, then.; Yeah, `sep=';'` is telling it to ignore the commas and look for (non-existent) semicolons.; So everything is one column now."
234,1547661460.5824,Nenita,that makes sense; maybe i could split it afterwords
234,1547661688.5837,Sasha,"It looks like if you explicitly pass in 17 column names with a `names` parameter, instead of header detection, it will give you NaN values when the 17th column doesn't appear, but will not error out."

234,1547663795.5855,Sasha,"That doesn't make a lot of sense. No errors, just missing data?"
234,1547663814.5859,Nenita,"yea, it's odd. let me see if i can post some of the text.; nvm, i was using header instead of name. name definitely did the trick, but out of 3 different types of reports/statements, i think leaving it at a default of 20 should be good.; thanks for the help"

235,1547668103.59,Jordon,"thanks ill give it a read; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; s = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')

236,1547671708.5922,Nenita,pd.df.append is appending my data vertically?
236,1547671891.5927,Clemmie,"Are you asking if that is what will happen, or that is happening and you don’t want it to?"
236,1547671918.5931,Nenita,"i noticed it's appending my data as a new column rather than a row; but not sure how to change that; not much arguments for append that i see in the documentation; i used .loc in the past for appending to the desired row, but i want to avoid that method"
236,1547672287.5956,Clemmie,"Seems like append should add a row. You could also try to make a new dataframe with the new data and then use concat  maybe? (I’m going by the docs, I only have a passing knowledge of pandas) <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.concat.html#pandas.concat>"
236,1547672390.5968,Nenita,"well i tried to directly insert the data creating a new dataframe, but its giving an error ""Shape of passed values is (1, 10), indices imply (10, 10)"""
236,1547672424.5973,Clemmie,And….you are beyond my panda knowledge. Sorry
236,1547672453.5976,Nenita,:grin: no worries
237,1547673173.5987,Marth,can you show your append code and possibly some sample data of what's in the df and what you're trying to append?
236,1547674468.5989,Nenita,sure one sec; I commented out the data because that's not in the code itself like that.; Here you can copy and paste this. just set your directory for the out file. gives the exact results i get.
237,1547676117.6029,Marth,"I've never tried creating a dataframe that way....I'll have to play with it a bit.  I'm at work right now, so I may not be able to respond immediately, but in the meantime, maybe try to avoid the dictionary portion until the end?  It seems as though you're setting your dict to be a dataframe on line 19 (I'm still learning pandas myself, so I could be wrong) but when I've used pandas, I do all or most of my pandas works with just dataframes and then nearer to the end might do a .to_dict() once I have all my data; or perhaps work with just dicts?; the append on line 20 looks like a ""dict"" append method"
237,1547676520.6078,Nenita,"to briefly explain the process: I am having to convert the companies statements to be formatted correctly for quickbooks import. for our lowes statements, each employee has their own section for each transaction. I posted the data layout a few hours ago. the application will be building each employees dictionary as a dataframe for each individual (upwards to 20 people) and populating each employee's name on a list. when clicked on, it will load that employees dataframe into a tkinter treeview for viewing before saving and exporting.; if I dont use a dictionary for each dataframe at the time of creation, the code will be messy because i may have to add a dataframe line by line for each employee. so i was hoping to assign each employee their dataframe and then insert that into a a dictionary to be called on when selected from the employee list."

238,1547691466.611,Shan,"it looks like the keys in `data` are what you want to associate to `apple` and the value is associated to `banana`.; dict can only contain unique keys.; so, you may consider `{'apple':['a', 'a1'], 'banana': ['b', 'b1']}`"
238,1547691586.6133,Hai,<@Shan> noo i need the single key value pair at a time; is  there anyway can i convert the dict to string ?
238,1547691624.6142,Shan,"well you can make it a list of dicts.; `[{'apple': 'a'}, {'apple': 'a1'}, {'banana': 'b'}, {'banana': 'b1'}]`"
238,1547691734.6157,Hai,noo is there any way can i manipulate the dict and make it happen?

238,1547691832.6182,Hai,yeahh my aim is to add apple and banana ass keys and vaues for the existing the json
238,1547691840.6183,Shan,"_why_ do you need `{""apple"":""a"",""Banana"":""b"",""apple"":""a1"",""Banana"":""b1""}`; why cant you do one of the other suggestions?"
238,1547691865.6188,Hai,"the api is build like that; yeah; how would i make them as list?; {'apple':['a', 'a1'], 'banana': ['b', 'b1']} i think this works; how would i make {'apple':['a', 'a1'], 'banana': ['b', 'b1']} this happen?"

238,1547692363.6215,Shan,elaborate what you mean; well actually; i get it; before appending them to `my_dict`.
238,1547692427.6242,Hai,the json what am getting has no value it just has a key. so my code doesn't work if it has no value. so instead of that i want to add a string just to  make it work
238,1547692440.6245,Shan,"do some conditionals on `k` or `v` and if either is None, assign the appropriate value with whatever string you want; like, `k = 'None'`; or. you can simply not deal with that data by ignoring it."
238,1547692475.6257,Hai,am getting these keys and values from an excel sheet which is columns and rows; None
238,1547693210.6264,Shan,"iterate through `b` and if the value is null, overwrite the value."
238,1547693287.6266,Hai,how??
238,1547693311.6269,Shan,leveraging a similar loop like i provided above.

243,1547741818.6476,Landon,"Hi all; So, I have a backend ready with API's and database, what python framework can I use to develop the frontend only? I have the HTML/CSS ready as well. I tried Django but it seems like you have to do the api and backend as part of a django project"
243,1547742039.6495,Mica,what do you mean frontend? Python frameworks are for backend; a frontend framework would be something like Vue or React
243,1547742214.6512,Landon,"Hi Jabob, the web application part of the project( what the user will interact with) yes like Vue, but is there a Python framework similar to Vue?"
243,1547742230.6518,Hiroko,"yeah, but would not advise that; because going from python to js means lots of leaky abstractions and less-than-optimal performance"
243,1547742284.6531,Landon,"Its not a new project, like mentioned, the backend and API's all is in place, but I want to redo the admin website"
243,1547742286.6532,Hiroko,"also, consider if you’re trying to do something that transpiler framework doesn’t support; you’re pretty much stuck and have to hack around.; GWT is a similar project for java to webapps, and its… not good"
243,1547742358.6551,Mica,would that be something like Flask and Jinja?
243,1547742365.6555,Landon,so its either starting the whole project from scratch using say Django or use Vue with the current backend and API's?
243,1547742377.6558,Mica,I'm not really sure what a frontend python would look like
243,1547742489.6568,Hiroko,check out <https://hackernoon.com/reconciling-djangos-mvc-templates-with-react-components-3aa986cf510a>

243,1547742516.6575,Hiroko,"you can’t sorry; if you want that in the browser, you need js to talk to your django server; which is via ajax calls"
243,1547742720.6603,Landon,"<@Hiroko> thank you. the backend server is mysql with MuleSoft delivering the REST API's. so for instance I thought ill be able to create the login page in html/css and once the user clicks on the login button ill connect to the REST API for the validation etc, but in a Django type of way within my HTML"
243,1547742788.661,Clemmie,If you already have a working api there is no reason to add django into the mix. It would just be a _very_ heavy way of serving html/css/js
243,1547742875.6618,Landon,"<@Clemmie>, yeah for sure, but is there a python web framework that can be used to do this?"
243,1547742908.6625,Clemmie,No. you need javascript.
243,1547742950.6632,Landon,"yeah so either go with Vue or .NET etc...ok all, thank you for your advise"
243,1547742963.6635,Clemmie,"nope, not .NET - that is C++; (or C#, I forget)"
243,1547742980.664,Landon,C#
243,1547743016.6647,Clemmie,"You can do native javascript (ES5/6),  React, Angular, Vue, or Ember basically"
243,1547743030.665,Landon,ok kewl.....now to learn JS; or do everything from scratch with Django
243,1547743192.6662,Clemmie,"Even if you do it all from scratch in django, if you want it to be api based, you will still need javascript"

x = &lt;string&gt;
clean = x.strip()

244,1547752350.6715,Rolando,nice thanks; but it should be strip(' '); right ?

248,1547764867.707,Sasha,"Yeah, Python is very flexible. Functions are basically just special kinds of objects that have a `__call__` attribute, so you can put them in lists, dicts, etc. too."
250,1547768855.7075,Marla,"That solves the problem of checking if each letter is in the alph. You are getting closer.
One thing that will happen if you use `alphabet` as a _string_ to store things, is that the letters will be out of order when they are added with `alphabet += i` and will never equal exactly `""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""` unless by perfect chance your input string is in alphabetical order.
If you want your `alphabet` string to equal exactly `""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""` (which is what saying `if ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" in alphabet:` does), you will have to sort `alphabet` somehow.
But, you should look into `set` and learn about why it will work great for this problem."

249,1547785930.7117,Sasha,"They didn't want the special names to overlap with likely names that programmers would use in their code, like ""init"".; Normally it doesn't matter as much, since if you want you can say `sum = 10` in your code, overwriting the built-in function, and nobody cares but you. But if it's a function like `__init__` that Python has to call itself on your class, it's bad to accidentally run something you didn't mean to."

script.py

271,1548000645.863,Jonas,ew?
271,1548000709.8639,Marita,The syntax for that. I’m assuming that where the asterisk is is where most of the elements are going?
271,1548000844.8647,Jonas,"seems clean to me. `x, *y, z` means x is the first element, z is the last and everything in-between goes into y"
271,1548000937.8655,Marita,Yeah. Just not a fan of the syntax. Personal preference. :)
272,1548001287.8662,Lessie,unpacking syntax is only beautiful in the eyes of the dev who wrote it xD anyone else would have an issue with it.
272,1548001383.8667,Hiroko,What alternative would you suggest?

273,1548004636.8772,Hiroko,"But tuple unpacking and the behavior of an asterisk is default in python and would have questions about your approach when reviewing any PR that includes this.

; And would there be some performance differences between the two, with slicing being less performant?"
273,1548004779.8808,Chester,"It's like iterating over indices (using `for idx in range(len(iterable))` instead of just iterating over elements (or using `enumerate`).
For a yesterday C(++) student `for idx, elem in enumerate(iterable)` may look worse, but this is how python works; This is what any python programmer expects to see; And yes, if you don't use `enumerate` much in your code, you'll need to look up what it does"
273,1548005153.8821,Roxanne,Can anybody help me with this question ? <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/211781/166600>
273,1548005245.8826,Jonas,none of that is particularly pythonic :confused:; the reason the `process_matches` is slow is the mongodb insert I expect; and it’s full of mixed concerns
274,1548005682.8832,Roxanne,what do you mean with mixed concerns ?
273,1548005705.8834,Roxanne,how should I tackle this instead ?
273,1548006715.8915,Ashley,"<@Roxanne> IMO for python and other languages in general, your biggest enemy will likely be your ability to maintain, rewrite, and extend upon large amounts of code. If you have a giant function, you should break it down anyway, regardless of performance. Whenever you have a slice of code that you can sum up with a simple English phrase, you should break that out into a function where that phrase is the name of the method. That helps compartmentalize your logic (making it easier to think about and debug), makes your code more testable/extensible/maintainable, makes your code document itself, and a whole slew of other benefits.

IIRC even NASA has a rule that a function has to be short enough to fit on one screen without scrolling (NASA also uses Python, which is awesome!).

Do you lose performance when doing this? In Python, technically, yes, but it's negligible (compiled languages can often optimize so this doesn't impact performance, anyway)."
273,1548006982.8942,Roxanne,"my trade off was basically having to :
1. Keep in self a big list of dictionaries (up to 20 mbs)
2. Do 3 `for` iteartions in separated methods instead of 1  (process_telemetry, process_match_scores, process_players_scores)

But actually makes sense if I end up, for instance, having better control of test or using async requests"

283,1548084947.9963,Malena,"I think request sockets need to have the hostname specified. The zeromq client example has it:
<http://zguide.zeromq.org/cpp:hwclient>; IIRC it's also something to do with the difference between `connect` and `bind`.; Actually yeah, that makes sense. You'e making a request socket, so it ought to be making a connection to a single reply host.; You bind the `zmq.REP` socket, and connect the `zmq.REQ` socket.; With `bind` you can use `*`."
283,1548085293.9985,Lawanna,"Has anyone here done some heavy production level work with schedulers? E.g do something at a specific time, interval, at this timezone
This scheduler can have over 100 active tasks a day, and the schedules can change dynamically (Stored in DB)
When individual tasks are triggered by the scheduer, based on some conditions some other tasks are also scheduled ahead of time.

Things I've tried - celery and huey"
283,1548085394.0006,Clemmie,I’ve used and have been happy with celery for a similar use case. I’m pretty sure it would be pretty much everyone’s first suggestion. Is there something about it you are unhappy with?
283,1548085616.0028,Carmelia,"Fantastic spot. This is exactly it, I was using `connect` instead of `bind`! Thanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
283,1548085977.0034,Hiroko,"celery would be my default fo this, with rabbit as a broker and redis as a backend; what do you feel celery is lacking for you with this requirement?; FWIW, at work we use celery extensively with indexing content, with celerybeat"
284,1548086385.0088,Lawanna,"Yep, on the surface celery has everything I need and more. My work load is not too crazy, compared to have I heard from other teams and read online. I'm currently curing celery beat with django-celery-beat (<https://github.com/celery/django-celery-beat>) so that I can have my tasks managed by the DB (postgres). This allows users to change schedules dynamically.

This past weekend I did a upgrade of my codebase from py2 to py3, and I switched from huey to celery and use native celery beat to handle scheduling.
Previously, I was doing a dumb loop to check for scheduled in a task that fired every minute.

I know... its not great but here is what I did.
```
#run every minute
def conditionally_run_other_tasks():
    # query database and see if some tasks should be run.
    # call the tasks in here and they will be enqueued and executed
```

Hence why I was really glad to move away from that. Having said that though, that little loop only missed a beat a couple of times a month.

I deployed celery yesterday and it has already missed about 5 tasks out of 40."
284,1548086720.0111,Clemmie,"There have been some issues in the past with celery and django-celery-beat around missing/lost periodic tasks. Are you on the most recent stable versions of everything (django, celery, django-celery-beat)?; Also are the tasks missed, or do you see a message in your redis log that they were dispatched but didn’t run?"
283,1548086826.0143,Clemmie,"Lastly, what is your celery stack? is it celery/rabbitmq/redis like <@Hiroko> suggested, or something different?"
283,1548086847.0145,Lawanna,"Yes, that's right. Hence why I went down the route of Huey. I wanted to use celery, because i've used it in the past for other projects. But this problem was worse before.


I believe I am on the latest and greatest.
```
celery==4.2.1
django-celery-beat==1.4.0
Django==2.1.4
```"
284,1548086882.0151,Lawanna,So celery should be using redis as the broker and django-celery-beat should be using Django ORM with Postgres for storing the schedules.
283,1548086928.0163,Hiroko,"can you determine whether the missing tasks were dispatched and not run, or not dispatched at all?"
283,1548086947.0166,Clemmie,"Just found this - might be helpful <https://www.vinta.com.br/blog/2017/how-make-sure-celery-beat-tasks-are-working/>; nevermind, just read it - not so helpful"
283,1548087089.0184,Lawanna,"Yes, I have datadog logging a bunch of stuff. I can show you some interesting graphs.

No tasks were dispatched between 4am and 7am UTC"
284,1548087115.0195,Lawanna,"So the scheduler did not send the task, I believe."

283,1548087230.0199,Hiroko,<@Arturo> <https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/index>; you can use that to find the index of the item and then use said index to retrieve it; <@Lawanna> :thumbsup: on having good monitoring in place

283,1548087299.0219,Arturo,perfect! I should have remembered that one :see_no_evil: <@Hiroko> :taco:
283,1548087357.0224,Hiroko,"was your db under high load at that time?; perhaps if it was under high load with elevated query times, perhaps the scheduler wasn’t able to fire off at the appropriate time due to a query timeout?; I’m just spitballing here; also are you logging db queries?"
283,1548087469.0238,Lawanna,"Nope, latency and and requests, seem pretty normal"
283,1548087482.0243,Hiroko,agreed
283,1548087552.0249,Lawanna,I am logging queries yes
283,1548087562.0252,Hiroko,"since the scheduler is db backed, I’m curious whether it actually executed the query; if so, it narrows down whether the failure happened before or after the db was checked"
283,1548087642.0268,Lawanna,"Then we would see a dip during that time no? The scheduler should have checked atleast a couple of times within that 2 hour period, because about 3 tasks were missed within that period"
283,1548087711.0269,Arturo,"ah actually there was a slight problem, it was to do with 'lte' not being the complete string, do you think I should use regex to get it?"
283,1548087757.0273,Hiroko,correct; which graph is the db monitor?; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14849293/python-find-index-position-in-list-based-of-partial-string>
283,1548087854.0289,Lawanna,"The first one is total requests, and 3rd is latency. Both are actually for postgres, the db"
283,1548087896.0293,Arturo,:thumbsup:
283,1548087901.0296,Hiroko,gotcha.  but it doesn’t show which query is being executed; just that something happened
283,1548087972.0307,Lawanna,"Oh right, the logs are below. Is there something specific you want to look at?; That time range?; Hows this."
283,1548088056.0316,Hiroko,"ah, ok.  so, the query did execute, and none of them have errors occured; hmm; and I assume they returned a result set; :thinking_face:"
283,1548088211.0349,Lawanna,"At the end of the day though, this is all quite low level. If I implemented this scheduler, then for sure, this investigation makes sense. But this is a library and I am at the mercy of its own implementation and bugs. Unfortunately, based on the number of issues piling up, its not very well supported.

Based on this awful performance on the first day, I might have to go back to the crude loop."
283,1548088272.0353,Hiroko,the primary advantage of django-celery-beat is the django admin integration; do you need that?
283,1548088312.0364,Lawanna,"I would have thought its also the models and the structure it setups to have the scheduler based on the DB, run by beat.; I don't use the admin too much, I look it at every now and then to check for schedule times; and to verify if that task should have fired"
283,1548088383.0377,Hiroko,:thumbsup:
283,1548088531.0395,Lawanna,"This is a core part of my app, so if you have another other suggestions for schedulers I am all for it. As far as I can tell, I can keep celery around and remove beat.

Have something else inspect the DB and keep an eye on what should fire when, and then tell celery to run it."

d to transform it into a list:
```
found_instances = list(search_for_instance(instances, names))
```; there is one main reason this is ""more optimized"" _(which does not mean better!)_ than your original code:
In your original solution, you create the entire list of names, then filter it down by the matching names.  By using a list comprehension with a filter built-in, this solution does not populate the list with all names, but only with names that match, thus saving space and saving the time required to allocate that space."

318,1548266173.2583,Lawanna,Hmm - is there a way to do that? Im using Django too
318,1548266282.2588,Ashley,"unicode is the default; just don't try to do any encoding/decoding, and you'll have unicode; it's different for python 2 though"
318,1548266557.2606,Nenita,"I have a challenge (mainly for myself) that I haven't been able to work out. I have one idea that
would work, but have very little knowledge on servers.

The scenario: A .fdb (firebird) database that cannot be accessed over a network via a custom ODBC
driver of our software provider.

Currently I have to remote into the server just to run queries, etc. I was thinking that a way I
could achieve running sql using pyodbc is to create a server using python to setup on the network
pc and my work pc. I would use that server to send sql commands and then the network pc server would
then run that sql command and return the results. How complex/long would you think this would be to setup?

Also, any other ideas to do this?"
318,1548266632.2613,Ashley,you can't just tunnel into the server?
319,1548266642.2615,Nenita,what do you mean by tunnel?
318,1548266662.262,Nenita,"servers are not my forte, but I've always wanted to delve into it."
318,1548266666.2622,Ashley,like SSH
318,1548266689.2629,Lawanna,Just create a reverse ssh tunnel
318,1548266694.2631,Ashley,"SSH is a network protocol (""Secure SHell"")"
318,1548266770.2654,Nenita,Is that the same as remoting in or would is it solely for sending commands?
318,1548266774.2656,Ashley,an SSH Tunnel is a where you punch a secure hole into a server from another node so you can run reach it over a network; SSH is very similar to remoting
318,1548266808.2669,Lawanna,"Also <@Ashley> so I first had to encode because I was doing this

```
""{site}/connect/{teamName}"".format(
                teamName=teamName
            )
````

Where teamName was a unicode string. and I got the error `'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf3' in position 13: ordinal not in range(128)`

So I had to decode it."
318,1548266825.2674,Ashley,SSH on it's own is basically letting you open up a shell/terminal/command prompt on another machinne over a network so you can run things as though you were on that server
318,1548266871.2689,Nenita,"don't mean to be antsy, but if i had ssh setup, how would pyodbc, or any other module for that manner, to work with the database?; shoot you answered too fast lol"
318,1548266908.2698,Ashley,"to explain SSH tunneling, let's say I have a DB on server A, but it's behind a firewall. I can't reach server A directly, so I SSH into server B which is on the same network as server A, but not bound by the same firewall rules; once I SSH into server B, I can SSH into server A"
318,1548266938.2705,Nenita,oh so its basically what i was wanting to create in python?; basically a backdoor server
318,1548266981.2716,Ashley,"an SSH Tunnel is a tool that basically does this for you, but usually for specific ports (like more complex port forwarding)"
318,1548267000.2721,Nenita,"im surprised i've never heard of ssh, but this is exciting news"
318,1548267011.2723,Ashley,"a backdoor _into the_ server, yes"
318,1548267013.2726,Nenita,:nerd_face:
318,1548267026.2729,Ashley,it's incredibly common; almost required; you would do yourself a huge favor to learn it
318,1548267076.274,Nenita,thats what im doing now. im going to be spending a lot of my time now setting this up. I can do everything i need to at my job through python except for accessing our main db
318,1548267188.2751,Ashley,"<@Lawanna> I would try to figuure out what in that code snippet was the actual ascii string, and try to trace it back to its source. If you're working in python 3, ascii shouldn't be cropping up like that; also, I would just bring it up to unicode's level so the rest of your code is easier to work with; <@Nenita> there's a ton of tools for SSH tunneling that make it pretty easy to work with. If you can get your hands on someone from devops for like 5 minutes, they should be able to heklp you set it up"
318,1548267361.2775,Lawanna,"Oh right - so from the requests library, from a payload response.; A json being converted to python dict"
318,1548267374.2781,Nenita,"yea, it seems relatively easy to setup, but just researching now on how I would run sql statements through it"
318,1548267431.279,Ashley,<@Lawanna> json and requests support unicode. I think there's another entity throwing in ascii somewhere; do you have any comments on the tops of any of your python files that mention ascii?
318,1548267479.28,Lawanna,"```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```; that is on the file"
318,1548267541.2816,Ashley,"<@Nenita> databases are queried usually by connecting to some hosted service designated by a port, so really you just need to worry about what port your DB expects a connection on, and what port you want to bind to your tunnel on your local machine (also the ports for the middle man)"
318,1548267557.282,Lawanna,"The flow is fairly simple in this case

```
        response = s.post(
            url=""%sv3/conversations"" % self.serviceUrl, 
            headers={
                ""Authorization"": ""Bearer {token}"".format(token=self.token),
                ""Content-Type"": ""application/json"",
            },
            data=json.dumps(req_payload)
        )
teamName = payload['channelData']['team']['name']
connect_url = ""{site}/connect/{teamName}"".format(
                teamName=teamName
            )
```"
318,1548267558.2821,Ashley,<@Lawanna> any others?
318,1548267571.2824,Lawanna,"Nothing else, just that comment on top"
318,1548267585.2827,Ashley,"I think `teamName` may be the culprit; try printing out the raw response that requests gets, i.e. `print(response.text)`; @wachu; woops; <@Nenita> to give a quick example, PostgreSQL uses a default port of 5432, so if I have a PSQL server running locally, I could connect to it with something like `psql localhost:5432` (I forget the actual syntax); but I would run that in my shell"
318,1548267905.287,Nenita,"im surprised through much research in the past, I had never found this type of solution. thanks very much for all the info."
318,1548267974.2877,Ashley,no problem!; good luck
318,1548268143.2885,Nenita,reading good luck made me think of Liem in the movie Taken :thinking_face:

320,1548271152.2923,Hiroko,"well, asyncio is in 3.4, I believe; if you want to go back to 2.7, trollius is a possibility but its no longer maintained; <https://github.com/vstinner/trollius>; tl;dr if you _really_ want asyncio, would suggest updating to at least 3.5"
320,1548271376.2947,Carlo,<@Hiroko> 3.4 asyncio is some preliminary version IIRC; e.g. used decorators and `yield from` syntax for coroutines
320,1548271912.2953,Hiroko,"agreed; but when working with an older version like 3.4 or older, things like that are to be expected"
320,1548272239.2963,Ashley,"<@Lazaro> just curious, but what holds you back from moving to the latest version of python?"

321,1548272446.2974,Lawanna,What am I looking for by doing that 
320,1548272604.2979,Ashley,"that sucks, but I get it"
321,1548272725.2991,Ashley,<@Lawanna> see if there's anything janky in the raw response that would allude to why it's not a standard string by the time you get to use it
320,1548273554.3012,Ashley,"<@Lawanna> I would triple check every python file you're script is utilizing (a grep will do the job) to make sure there's no other encoding lines. Maybe one of them is encoding as ascii. I would also make sure you're not soomehow using python 2 for this. If it's not either of those things, try taking out all the text coding comments and see if that is somehow causing the problem"

327,1548293030.3106,Sau,"hi guys

just have a quick quesion
Assume there is a Mac and a HP computer each has an Intel microprocessor. Would an assembly program produced using the Mac computer run on the HP computer? (edited)
I think it would be yes, but not sure about the OS
I wonder if the OS can affect to assembly"
327,1548293281.3124,Sasha,"The actual assembly instructions would be basically the same, but in practice you're probably going to run into problems with the executable format, for instance... a Windows .EXE and a MacOS .APP will be different for the OS to load and run them.; And of course almost anything the program does will need to involve system calls for input and output, etc."
327,1548294178.3134,Sau,hmm; interesting; so I guess I can run assembly on different OS as long as I have the same CPU
327,1548294229.3155,Hiroko,"Agreed. If your just doing register and accumulator arithmetic, yes the code will be portable. But you would need the os to execute the asm code ; And that would require os specific compilation. ; If you're thinking of doing osx and Linux, I think the chances of more portability are greater, since osx is a Unix based system ; Windows, however, is definitely most certainly not a Unix system "
327,1548294374.319,Sau,"so <@Hiroko> the assembly code is still portable however I don’t know why the executable format be the problem. As long as the code runs and compiles and computes what I want it to do, then would it be good to go ?"
327,1548294399.3192,Hiroko,You can try it ; But I doubt it; Because the asm code is just a small part of the problem ; The way programs are executed is very different between operating systems 
327,1548294497.321,Sau,"ah I see; if your theory is right, then the Executable format will not make the AS code to be running on different OS"
327,1548294612.3244,Kiera,"specifically, the way programs are *loaded* by the OS into memory, with the memory manager set up for the address space.  also, most programs don't really have much effect if they can't do I/O or interact at all, and that's going to require invoking kernel functions, which can be wildly different between OSes."
327,1548294643.325,Sasha,"The ""compile"" part is where you need to specify to compile into _what_... an EXE, an ELF, etc."
327,1548294936.326,Sau,so pretty much the OS is hugely affecting the way of the Assembly code can run.
327,1548294952.3267,Hiroko,How else can it be?
327,1548295003.3278,Sau,I guess that is it . The only thing that I concern is to have the same Assembly code running on Mac and Windows; I have all of them running on x86 the same CPU
327,1548295045.3294,Hiroko,You can try but I seriously doubt you'll come close to success ; Cpu architecture is just a small part of what you're working with 
327,1548295096.3309,Sau,I see
327,1548295204.3327,Sasha,I think the function calling conventions for register use might even be different.
327,1548295402.3343,Hiroko,"Essentially <@Sau> you have to compile per operating system you want to run on. The differences are too drastic to expect one compile to run on another system ; I mean, even rollercoaster tycoon, which was 99% x86 asm, had to be compiled for the different platforms it was released for ; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sawyer wrote 99% of the code for RollerCoaster Tycoon in x86 assembly language, with the remaining one percent written in C.[2] The graphics were designed by artist Simon Foster using several 3D modeling, rendering, and paint programs.[2] For his efforts, Sawyer made around $30 million in revenue.[4] The Xbox port was handled by Frontier Developments, who would later go on to develop later titles in the series."
327,1548296499.3366,Sasha,Tackling a project of that magnitude in assembly is... yikes.
328,1548302326.3389,Clayton,What is the equivalent of  pandas df.head()  in a python variable ? would it be just a slice or is there a function ?
328,1548302511.3392,Sasha,"Yeah, I think a slice would be the usual equivalent.; Also `itertools.islice()` if you have an iterator that doesn't support slicing."

336,1548354173.3894,Nenita,thanks. couldnt find that anywhere sadly
337,1548354254.3897,Hiroko,"FYI, we do have an <#C297RQP0X|os_linux> channel here"
337,1548366733.3906,Rodrick,None
337,1548366792.3918,Hiroko,"the format is

```try:
   # do something
except &lt;SomeException&gt;:
   # handle exception
```"
337,1548366807.392,Rodrick,ok; I am trying to see if num1 and 2 are real numbers.
337,1548367064.3927,Claudine,you're using `if` statements incorrectly
337,1548367076.3932,Rodrick,Yeah?
337,1548367077.3933,Claudine,"they need a body
```
if (statement):
   do a thing
```"
337,1548367083.3935,Rodrick,ok
337,1548367110.3941,Hiroko,do you know any other language?
337,1548367110.3942,Claudine,"i don't know that you'll get the expected behavior out of your `try` statement like that; also if you want to check if those are integers you can try `isinstance(num1, int)`; that will return a yes or no"
337,1548367159.3955,Rodrick,ok; I'll do that
337,1548367211.3967,Claudine,"```
if (isinstance(num1, int) &amp;&amp; isinstance(num2, int)):
    your things are integers so do what you want here
else:
   your things are not integers so handle that appropriately
```; that may work out easier for ya; `if int(num1) == num1:` i think would fail if num1 was any number cast as a string, so like the string `12345` would fail even though it can represent a valid number, So you'll want to make sure your `num1` and `num2` are the correct type"
337,1548367336.3985,Rodrick,Ok
337,1548367374.3991,Claudine,"then again if you try to cast a string representation of an integer to an int, and that string does not represent an integer youll probably fail too"

338,1548370535.4009,Marc,i have a question; i got an asked in an interview to write a function that takes a word; and prints out all the upper and lower case permutations of that word; like; foo; foO; fOo; etc; but they said dont use itertools..
338,1548370566.4032,Rodrick,ok; i know
338,1548370590.4039,Marc,would you just loop over each character and capitalize a random letter in the word; add it to the list; and then keep doing until all the combinations are in a list?; idk just doesnt seem efficient
338,1548370633.405,Rodrick,None; Oh
338,1548370643.4057,Marc,well that just does

338,1548370674.4094,Marc,i went to itertools; but he said dont use itertools
338,1548370682.4099,Rodrick,ok
338,1548370682.41,Shan,why would you use itertools?
338,1548370686.4102,Rodrick,ill look
338,1548370691.4105,Marc,"cause it has permutations?; :confused:; i mean i see an answer on stackover flow; but thats cheating; anyways, I didn't get to a solution and probably failed the interview. I was just curious what you people thought"

340,1548375877.4149,Sasha,"Easiest way I can think of to do it is to loop through range(2^n), and set each character to upper or lower case based on the i-th bit in the counter value.; Basically the same as counting in binary, with 0=lower, 1=upper."
341,1548377784.4154,Myron,"Wouldn’t a nested loop achieve that? For each letter, loop for each remaining letter, using both a capital and small version of each letter. As this will create some combinations twice, you save results in a `set()`, which ensures you don’t get duplicates."
340,1548377943.4156,Sasha,"Yeah, a recursive solution would also work. Iterative nested loops are difficult if you don't know in advance how many letters you have."
340,1548383034.4166,Kiera,"or use a recursive generator function...

355,1548434876.4744,Yaeko,<@Nenita> I don't understand. You have a string containing `\n` and it's not printed to a new line when you use `print()`?
352,1548434880.4745,Clemmie,can you show the code you are using to print
355,1548434974.4747,Nenita,None
355,1548435010.4755,Yaeko,`print(stdout.read().decode('utf-8'))`
352,1548435052.4765,Nenita,not gunna lie. i always thought that the utf-8 was never really necessary
355,1548435055.4767,Nenita,mind blown
355,1548435059.4769,Yaeko,Or whatever character encoding you have set up. Might be possible to just use `.decode()`.
355,1548435069.4773,Nenita,fixed it perfectly
355,1548435080.4777,Yaeko,But you need to decode the bytes (`b'string'`) into a string (`'string'`)

352,1548436818.4806,Cammie,"I seem to always have issues with virutal environments with python.

I’m attemtping to create a new virtual environment in my project’s repo by using

`$ python3 -m venv venv`

Then I attempt to activate the virtual envrionment by using

`$ source ./venv/bin/activate`

I’m having issues install packages using pip3, I’m getting errors that say:

&gt; Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ‘/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/prompt_toolkit-1.0.15.dist-info/DESCRIPTION.rst’                                                                                                 │·

So I looked at which pip3 i’m using with

`$ which pip3`

365,1548467704.5696,Elza,well its actually py2 I apologize; which is this py2=“/usr/local/bin/python2”
365,1548467757.5707,Ashley,"ok, either way, it looks like those are different python executables, meaning different environments; one has `bs4` installed, and the other doesn't"
365,1548467827.5714,Elza,ah I see; Another question is dotenv a builtin module from python?
365,1548467906.5721,Ashley,I don't believe so
365,1548467915.5723,Elza,ok; huh thanks for the help
365,1548469021.5727,Ashley,np
366,1548471540.5728,Chester,Yes
367,1548486182.5732,Conchita,"Thanks for this, will try to implement an iterator protocol!; For one of my apps that is meant to run continously, I noticed it stopped running. When I ssh into my server I see the screen session from where I was running the app is `deattached`; Excluding human interaction, what could lead to a screen becoming `deattached`?"
367,1548487422.5765,Sasha,I think that would happen if the ssh connection the screen was started from got disconnected. Normally you would purposefully detach the screen session so it would continue to run while you're not on a live connection.
367,1548487518.5771,Conchita,How do you purposefully detach the screen session to allow it to run after I log off?
367,1548487540.5774,Sasha,"CTRL+A D, I believe.; You should be able to reattach to the old screen session and see if your app printed out any errors."
367,1548487689.5785,Conchita,"Ok thanks, will try it out. Have a :taco: <@Sasha>"
368,1548516598.5811,Roxanne,Can anybody help me wiith this one ? <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212270/api-client-querying-data-out-of-an-endpoint>
369,1548519184.5825,Coleen,"Guys perhaps you could help me out a bit to flesh out a class that would implement a certain behaviour. So basically the way I want to use it is:
```
MyData['zero']['excited'].method() 
```; The backstory is that I use a nested dict so far, and I want to add some methods to it.; The dict is
```
MYDATA = { # mapping from executable names to what they represent
    'zero' : {
        'ground' : 'dish',
        'excited' : 'ztes'
    },
    'finite' : {
        'ground' : 'skys',
        'excited' : 'ftes' 
    }
}
```"
370,1548519872.5843,Wendi,DO I have to know algorithms before learning python?
369,1548519956.5848,Coleen,Why not learn both at the same time: <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html>
369,1548520146.5866,Chester,<@Coleen> what kinds of methods?
369,1548520369.5874,Coleen,"Yea so for example the kind of stuff I'm doing with the nested dict right now:
```
    # check if input files are present in the workspace
    for temp in ('zero', 'finite'):
        for state, suffix in zip(('ground', 'excited'), (""_dis.dat"", ""_start.dat"")):
            fpath = os.path.join(args.workspace, CODE_NAME[temp][state] + suffix)
            if not os.path.isfile(fpath):
                sys.exit(f""{fpath} not found, exiting."")
```; There could be a method `input_file()` which returns the corresponding file name, ie `MyData['zero']['ground'].input_file()` would return `dish_dis.dat`,; Not sure it's the right abstraction, but something like this is what I had in mind.; Then another method `MyData.all_input_files()` would return a list containing all input file names: [`dish_dis,dat`, `skys_dis,dat`, `ztes_start.dat`, `ftes_start.dat`]; Or `MyData['zero'].input_files()` would return  `[dish_dis,dat, ztes_start.dat]` and
`MyData['ground'].input_files()` would return `[dish_dis,dat, skys_dis,dat]`; Does it make sense?"
369,1548521254.5931,Chester,"That syntax is possible due to dynamic nature of python, but I would advise to implement a more common api:
instead of `MyData['zero']['ground'].input_file()` do `MyData.input_file('zero', 'ground')`; Same for `MyData['zero'].input_files()`: do `MyData.input_files('zero')` instead"
369,1548521335.5937,Coleen,I see.; And I would store the nested dict inside the class right?
369,1548521353.5943,Chester,"Yes; ```
class MyData:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = data
    def input_file(self, first, second):
        return self._data[first][second] + '_dis.dat'
```
Something like that."
369,1548521443.5956,Coleen,:slightly_smiling_face:
369,1548521498.5968,Chester,"Btw, there is nothing wrong with not having methods on your `MyData` class and write functions instead, that operate on dictionaries"
369,1548521523.5971,Coleen,what do you mean?
369,1548521597.5984,Chester,"```
def input_file(data, first, second):
    return data[first][second] + '_dis.dat'
```; Where `data` is your dictionary"
369,1548521621.5991,Coleen,Oh you mean not writing a class at all
369,1548521625.5993,Chester,Exactly
369,1548521642.5999,Coleen,But I feel the dict and these functions belong together.
369,1548521692.6005,Chester,"Maybe, maybe not - you can always refactor a bunch of functions into a class later."
369,1548521712.6011,Coleen,"And since the nested dict was a global constant before, should I make this class a singleton?"
369,1548521720.6013,Chester,"Extracting methods from classes, on the other hand, may be difficult because of uncontrollable implicit dependencies on `self`; You see, singletons are a thing in java, but in python there is nothing wrong with a regular global variable :slightly_smiling_face:; Because of how imports work in python, you get singleton behavior out of the box"
369,1548521790.6028,Coleen,"Yes, but if the variable becomes a class?"
369,1548521827.6039,Chester,"You'll need to instantiate it somewhere, yeah. `my_data = MyData()`. And only then you'll be able to call methods on `my_data`"
369,1548521858.6044,Coleen,But the problem is I will have to instantiate it at the top level of the module.
369,1548521866.6047,Chester,Why is this a problem?
369,1548521872.6049,Coleen,"Because it's used in various functions.; Because it creates a global var.; So I read global constants are OK in Python, but not global vars?"
369,1548521949.6061,Chester,Uhm; There are no constants in python
369,1548522047.6081,Ashley,"<@Coleen> global constants are fine in Python because they are unchanging, hence the name ""constant"", but global variables are a code smell (usually) because things in multiple parts of your code migght depend on those things and have to change them, but you can't know which parts will do so, or when they'll do it, so it opens you up to a whole mess of problems; <@Chester> is right that there are no constants in python; but you can create objects that you treat as constants; and that's fine"
369,1548522087.6094,Coleen,how
369,1548522096.6098,Ashley,"you'll see that commonly done to avoid things like ""magic numbers"""
369,1548522113.6104,Coleen,by giving them a name in capitals? :slightly_smiling_face:
369,1548522120.6107,Ashley,you just create an object in the global namespace of a module like any other
369,1548522138.6114,Chester,Yes. A capitalized variable doesn't differ from a non-capitalized variable.
369,1548522142.6115,Ashley,"all-caps names are a good indicator to othhers that they are constants, and you should definitely do that; but what makes them ok is how they are meant to be used"
369,1548522191.6128,Coleen,but if someone else takes my code and he doesn't know how this class is meant to be used?
369,1548522195.613,Ashley,"for example, if I create this: `NY_TAX_RATE = 0.0725`, that's fine; that's why you make  them all caps; because it tells other developers that they shouldn't change those things; similarly, python doesn't have private attributes"
369,1548522254.6152,Chester,"<@Coleen> to solve that particular problem, we write docstrings for classes, methods and functions. In these docstrings we show examples and explain how this class/method/function should be used"
369,1548522272.6157,Ashley,"but we try to tell other developers when we want them to treat an attribute as private by starting it with a `_`, e.g. `_super_secret_thing`; that too"
369,1548522292.6162,Coleen,:slightly_smiling_face:
369,1548522310.6166,Ashley,"the abstractions were written because you wanted your code to be easy to use; if people are finding it easier to use your ""private"" attributes than the other things meant for that, then you either didn't make something easy to use, or you didn't document it sufficiently enough; on a related note, the bit about global objects that aren't constants being a code smell is what <@Chester> was saying regarding ""singleton behavior out of the box"". But that's why it's a code smell"
369,1548522847.6193,Coleen,I see; Thanks guys!
369,1548523511.6198,Ashley,np!
371,1548523981.6219,Janessa,"hello may i ask you guys something,  idid install windows and linux along each other but after i shut down linux and open my pc again to activate windows, windows get stucked or i can hear the sound of operating system opening but screen is black still and i have to force shut down again and again until it opens normally,,what may be the problem?"
371,1548524749.6236,Ashley,"<@Janessa> I'd guess it's either a corrupted install of windows, loose/janky video cable to the display, bad video driver (try rebooting a few times into safe mode to see if it consistently boots with no problems), or a bad GPU"
371,1548524890.6245,Janessa,<@Ashley> actually i had windows just installed linux along with it with partitions
371,1548524929.6248,Ashley,"yeah, it could still be something like a bad sector on yourr hard drive; IIRC the install disc for windows should have an analysis tool you can run to see if anything is messed up"
371,1548525331.626,Janessa,can i download this tool?
371,1548525533.6264,Ashley,"oh, no you just boot into the install media that you installed it from; like you wanted to reinstall it; it should be something like ""Installation repair/diagnostic"" or something"
371,1548525680.6276,Janessa,"aha ok, thnx"
371,1548525724.6278,Ashley,np
372,1548529332.629,Coleen,"There was decorator for adding a function that is not a method to a class, what was it"
372,1548529390.6293,Hiroko,I think you might be thinking of monkey-patching
372,1548529401.6297,Sasha,`@staticmethod`?
372,1548529403.6298,Ashley,I wouldn't worry about that for now; Try to keep the functions in a class related to the state of the object
372,1548529440.6311,Coleen,<@Thomasina> thats it
372,1548529442.6313,Ashley,"If they don't use `self`, then it probably doesn't need to be a function for that class"
373,1548531097.636,Somer,"I like `@staticmethod` for db models for entity utility  functions. They don't use `self`, but produce instances that do. :upside_down_face: "
374,1548532666.6374,Coleen,is using **kwargs in function arguments considered evil?
374,1548532878.6385,Sasha,"Depends on how you use it. Passing arguments from a child class to a superclass, for instance, is pretty standard."
374,1548532899.6389,Coleen,"no, from one func to another"
374,1548533123.6398,Sasha,"Again, depends. Sometimes it's an elegant simplification, other times it's an obscure hack, heh heh."
374,1548533137.6401,Coleen,its just that the number of parameters is so large; an if i change it in one function i need to change it in the other as well; very error probe; prone
374,1548533229.6418,Sasha,A large number of parameters that's common across functions is often a sign that you should be putting them together into a class that holds the parameter information.
374,1548533263.6421,Coleen,that's what i was worried about :smile:
374,1548533380.6431,Sasha,"Or possibly make a simple compound object that holds the parameters together, like a dataclass / named tuple."

375,1548537209.6616,Hiroko,I would argue that applying good practices to either is a time saver ; Using the right tool for the right job

375,1548537550.6744,Sasha,"For what it's worth, I'm on <@Coleen>’s side here. It's a pretty compact, obvious way to represent what he's trying to achieve. ""Explicit is better than implicit."""
375,1548537609.6751,Jonas,Using a template is just as explicit...?
375,1548537646.6758,Coleen,yes but introduces external dependency
375,1548537654.676,Sasha,It is essentially a template. I'm not sure what's gained by pulling in a library to do the same thing a built-in feature handles.
375,1548537679.6763,Jonas,"Would you make the same argument in a discussion about requests vs urllib?; If not, what's the difference here?"
375,1548537772.6774,Coleen,"""experimental python 3 support"", really?"
375,1548537817.6783,Jonas,"just playing devils advocate. A list comprehension is a hell of a lot better than jinja, and better than essentially an unrolled one."
375,1548537880.6789,Sasha,But don't you need to unroll everything anyway to set up the input to the comprehension? You're not going to get away with less than one line per line.
375,1548537918.6791,Jonas,"It's stable as hell in python 3, that section of the docs is really old. jinja 2.7 was released in *2013*"
375,1548538072.6794,Coleen,"ok, sounds good then :slightly_smiling_face:; anyway i need to learn it for some HTML stuff later on"
375,1548538299.6821,Hiroko,"<@Sasha> two things I think would benefit bringing jinja or a template engine into this.  I can easily see the output needing to be changed, whether by <@Coleen> or someone else that takes over this code.  Using existing convention lowers the difficulty of someone else taking over.  In addition, chances are Andrei will come across a similar issue or one in which Jinja is being used, so _his_ rampup time for that would be drastically lessened by existing expertise"
375,1548538399.6829,Sasha,Fair enough. I just worry about the tendency to use a pneumatic hammer-drill just to hang a picture.  :wink:
375,1548538432.6838,Coleen,In all fairness I would have to use jinja later on for some HTML generation so that's a valid point.
375,1548538433.684,Hiroko,"oh, for sure, and I do as well,  Its a balance, being pragmatic and thinking long term; but I also feel a half hour or a half day’s effort to apply good practices when working on similar code saves myself alot of swearing at the idiot who did this piece of crap (and I was usually said idiot)"
375,1548538529.6855,Jonas,"this is the question I really want answering; ""why use requests when we have urllib?"", isn't this the same argument?"
375,1548538728.687,Sasha,It's similar. I personally wouldn't necessarily fault someone for using urllib if they didn't require more advanced functionality.
375,1548539382.6879,Coleen,"So how would I convert to jinja, wrap the whole thing in `Template`?"
376,1548541969.6893,Karoline,"I use urllib pretty often instead of requests.  if I'm not doing a ton it's often just as easy, and it makes it so I don't need another dependency"

question for you-
how does one extracts the value of ""Name"" (1) from this output, which according to Python, type = bytes (or str, depends on how you run the command that outputs this thing. btw don't know if it matters but it's the output of the docker-hub command.. which you can get the cli by installing it via pip):

They shouldn't depend on each other being run in order to work. THey should assumee they are the only test being run at any given moment; also, try to make sure that if you run your tests in parallel, they won't interfere with each other; to help make that happen, make sure any code that would change the state of your test subject is never in a test function/method, and is in a fixture; make sure your fixtures do/return 1 thing, and are named appropriately. YOu don't want to have one fixture that does 7 steps for you. INstead, just make those steps individual fixtures that you can reuse several places"

```import decimal
test = [<tel:100.0897463|100.0897463>, 1.099999939393,1.37382829829393,29.1937462874847272,2.095478262874647474]

394,1548658748.7502,Demetrice,Maybe not. But i also don't know how to really use list slicing either; I think maybe when i iterate through my perimeter it's picking up on a 5 adding the 50 points. but then removing the other 5 so it never adds the second set of 50 points; But my understanding of the problem might be wrong because if that's the case it should be clarified when i told it to remove n instead of 5. but that didn't fix it.

# * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the
#   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).

# * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
#
# * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.

394,1548660532.7574,Sasha,It's the `remove` call using brackets.; So this is a decent step. It's obviously useful to have a count value for how many 1's you have. Would it be useful to have count values for every dice value?
394,1548660681.7578,Demetrice,Right it was supposed to be parenthesis; Yes it would. So i think i'm nearing the end of this; My code is going to be really ugly; But i was able to pass the test for the 3 1's; But you're right it's not going to work for everything else. So i need to copy that format and use it for all the other ones; But it's going to be really ugly and inefficient. For tonight i suppose i'll just focus on making it pass
394,1548660785.759,Sasha,"If you find yourself duplicating code, there's probably a way to combine them.; The time you spend writing code you know to be crappy is probably better spent thinking of a good way to do it. It's learning, after all.; You don't want to teach yourself bad habits."
394,1548660952.7596,Demetrice,Hmm; Good point; Well now i know one way it can work. But i guess fully writing it wouldn't be best; Hmm

407,1548696433.8156,Carrol,I’m not familiar with Paramiko but I think what you’re doing is sending raw data to the socket instead of getting a pty to send data to. The docs for `invoke_shell` imply you’d need to ask for a pty first: <http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.4/api/channel.html#paramiko.channel.Channel.invoke_shell>; You might want to look at Fabric which probably has a friendlier API than Paramiko (which it uses for the SSH operations) <https://www.fabfile.org>

411,1548708295.8373,Lamont,"Hi all! I’m new here so if this isn’t the place to ask something like this, please let me know!

I am working on a problem from <http://CodeWars.com|CodeWars.com> and my algorithm implementation is not fast enough. Would anyone here mind looking through my implementation and suggesting improvements? Codes ~40 lines"
410,1548708484.8382,Carrol,<@Lamont> go ahead and paste your code here. (use the + button and choose ‘code or text snippet’)
411,1548708527.8386,Lamont,"Here’s the prompt:

”
Given a positive number n &gt; 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n. The result will be a string with the following form :

 “(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)”
with the p(i) in increasing order and n(i) empty if n(i) is 1.

Example: n = 86240 should return “(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)”
”; My workflow is to find the primes (starting with primes smaller than 50) and dividing the provided  number, n, by primes, recording the number of times n is divided by each prime. I then use these recorded numbers in the return; My current thinking is that, while it passes the provided test case, it may be stalling during the while loop “while n &gt; 1:“, for an edge case, such as when n is divided multiple consecutive times by a single prime, in the while loop “while n % prime == 0:”"
411,1548709021.8422,Raven,"If you're not sure if it's stalling or not, one first step would be to find out. You could consider adding something like `print(n)` inside the loop. (Not sure if printing works on CodeWars, but if not, that's a good reason to try the code on your own machine, perhaps)"
411,1548709144.8438,Lamont,"Thanks <@Raven>, I’ll give that a go. I’m also pretty sure that large while loop “while N &gt; 1:” has the greatest time complexity out of my whole algo, so I’m going to try to condense it and see if that helps"
411,1548709249.8443,Raven,"Minor code clarity hint - you don't need an `if` outside a `while` with the same condition; It's also not clear why you would regenerate the primes list, since most of the contents aren't going to change between calls. If you really do need to expand the list as you go along, just calculate from the end onwards"
411,1548709398.8471,Lamont,"Yeah, I debated putting that “if” statement there but decided on including it, in order to make it easy to break out of the for-loop after n is divided by the given prime number the maximum number of times. This was an attempt to let the algo break out of the for-loop after factoring that prime number out of n; I could do that by converting getPrimes into a generator"
411,1548709507.8486,Raven,"Ah, I see. I guess it's times like this I wish Python had a do..while loop.; Without wanting to disturb things too much, you might also consider a recursive approach, starting with the largest prime smaller than `n` and working downwards until you find an integer factor, and then you can repeat the process for each of those, etc"
411,1548709943.8504,Lamont,"I was just thinking something along the lines, working from larger to smaller prime factors. Great idea — I’ll give it a shot now!; Turns out the solution is to just iterate i from 1 to n, checking if n is divisible by i. If it is, include it in the answer. Any non-prime i will be disregarded as it is a multiple of a smaller prime, of which n is not divisible"
411,1548714923.8559,Sasha,Although you can terminate at sqrt(n). Anything larger must be prime.
412,1548715384.8566,Carmen,"Optimization: You can iterate over odds greater than 2, since 2 is the only positive even number that's also a prime.; Pro-tip: Read the code if it's available, don't just comment on text descriptions of solutions. Then you don't look like a dunce like me when the optimization you mention was already there."
412,1548715622.86,Lamont,"Yep, getPrimes() stops at n**0.5+1 and returns only primes, removing any evens; :joy: love it, <@Carmen>. Still, thanks a ton for taking the time to look into my code!"

414,1548724857.8685,Sasha,"Checking... I may be mistaken, as a lot of examples just use a filename. Is there any chance that the error is coming from the JSON parsing itself, i.e. could the JSON in the file be invalid?; Can you post the full traceback?"
414,1548725016.87,Hai,it is valid. if i run it in my local am not getting any error. I containerized the script and running the container with this script.

420,1548751302.9109,Jimmy,you can easily push message to slack by calling a unique webhook url; that's the easiest way to do it

420,1548751520.9137,Valeri,<@Conchita> You'll have to create a Slack app probably
420,1548751524.9139,Jimmy,"you can but that's not really necessary, let me look it up"

420,1548751618.9158,Jimmy,<https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient>; you can probably use that as library :point_up:; but it's just an http request so you don't really have to
420,1548751966.917,Valeri,Clients are always better tho; You won't need to handle network errors yourself; at least
420,1548752038.9182,Jimmy,"true, but something like requests would be enough; I doubt the slack client does much more,; probably a bit of formatting since the API is not consistent in that regards"
420,1548752108.9192,Conchita,"Would something like this work? This is after I have created a slack app, enabled webhooks and generated my webhook address (which I masked in my example)"
420,1548752137.9203,Jimmy,I don't think the payload should be like that
420,1548752140.9204,Conchita,"Or I mean, I know this isn't working - I received `invalid output`. I mean is it something close to this I neeed to do?"

420,1548752581.9246,Jimmy,so by putting `json` you tell request that your payload is json and it encodes it for you and set the content-type header to json; without that data is sent in another format and slack wants it in json

421,1548758033.9268,Alicia,"Hi guys,
I have a question but I couldn’t find any answer elsewhere…
There’s a way to force conda to download packages only from pypi?"
421,1548758279.9273,Jimmy,I'm not familliar with conda but is there any advantages using it if you only download stuff from pypi ?
420,1548758748.9328,Alicia,"<@Jimmy> the advantages of using conda are (IMO):
• that is easy to use
• it has already been spread across the company I work in
• A good dependency mgmt (but not as good as pipenv or poetry ones)
• It automatically downloads the python version you ask for your env

Why I want it to download only from pypi?
• Because sometimes it messes up with packages for strange reasons
• It seems to use custom builds for packages for different versions of python
• Custom builds “are not exportable” as requirement file since they are custom (but they are exportable as a conda-like requirements file)"
420,1548758906.9335,Jonas,The cons in that list clearly outweigh the pros

420,1548759914.9379,Chuck,"yes, what does your actual input string look like"
420,1548759941.9381,Valeri,yes
420,1548760020.9387,Renna,<https://pastebin.com/ukJxhAAW>; i can parse it but i was hoping for a more generic solution; it has two json strings embedded in a string; maybe parser like this might be able to scan and select all valid json trees <https://pythonhosted.org/pyrser/tutorial1.html>; which might be the more general solution
420,1548760205.9402,Valeri,And you need a solution using python or php?
420,1548760294.9404,Renna,well atm i am using python
420,1548760316.9406,Alicia,didn’t worked :confused:
420,1548760454.9408,Renna,i need to do a bit more reading i guess if i want a generalized solution <https://tomassetti.me/parsing-in-python/>
420,1548760604.9411,Valeri,"Your use case is pretty straightforward imo; You just have to pickup stuff between `{}` and form a dict right?; To convert a string back to json you have `json.loads()`; <@Renna>; So, what exactly are you trying to achieve?; And tell us more about your use case?"
420,1548760808.9424,Renna,yea correct - well there are actually two json strings; one at the very end saying total rows returned; I think i might make a handcrafted solution for now but i might make a more general solution as a side project - it should be possible
420,1548761274.943,Valeri,Sure; I can already think of a two-pointers based solution; Lemme know if you'd like to do it as a side project. I'd contribute <@Renna>

not_present_script = inter_freq_internal_freq['Script'].loc[dat_thing]```; and then break up that thing into something more understandable as well; idk, maybe this makes perfect sense in pandas world xD; my understanding is that a single line of code should do a single thing, this long line that you posted does like 3 nested lookups.

What happens after a few hours is that the tool continues to write data to my db, but all of the entries have values at 0 (See the image).

I assume what happens is that Twitter shuts off my connection, but they way I have coded this, my app continues to run. I'm unsure how to fix this however.

423,1548767115.9669,Leida,that would do it; only your while loop keeps on going; stream.disconnect() disconnects but does stream.filter() connect?
423,1548767333.9689,Conchita,"I'm pretty sure it does, but can't be 100% due to lack of proper logging in the past"
423,1548767406.9697,Leida,"what triggers your db write tho?; an uncaught exception would break the while loop and that bit of code stops, if you have some external db write that does the write without regard to whether it has data or not could explain the 0's"
423,1548767612.9735,Conchita,"I know this is not best practice but the logic is as follow; I use global variables.
1) These are updated as data is processed
2)  Then a while loop read those globals and writes to the db
3) globals are reset
4) while loop sleeps for x seconds
5) repeat; None"
423,1548767831.9756,Leida,and you have some threading so that you can have two blocking while loops going?

423,1548767984.979,Leida,anyway the main point is that an uncaught exception jumps out of your reading while loop and no new data goes into your globals
423,1548767992.9793,Conchita,Full of bad practice and not knowing exactly what I'm doing; Exactly
423,1548768065.9806,Leida,catch the exception that does this and fix the problem

423,1548768101.9819,Leida,"try not to keep a catch-all in your code, would add to the list of bad ideas ^^"
423,1548768164.9832,Conchita,"Absolutely, only using it now for testing so I can find the ninja exception so I can add it to the small list of specific exceptions; Could you shed some light on threading and why not having it is a bad idea when using two while loops?"
423,1548768214.9843,Leida,"threading is not a good idea for you right now, so not having it is good :smile:; i just cant tell how you can have two blocking while loops going, unless they are nested ^^"
423,1548768373.9865,Conchita,One while loop is inside a function. The second is not. If that answers your Q; None
423,1548768561.9876,Leida,now im confused how it enters any data besides the first time atall :smile:

this was the question maybe you missed it out"
423,1548768597.9886,Leida,"you run the script, definitions are loaded and then the code hits if __name__ line which calls main(); the main contains an endless loop that wont stop unless some error that you are not catching break it; and only then should the writing to database loop start; in the while run: bit do you call main() again somewhere?"
423,1548768731.9911,Conchita,"No; That while loop that starts off at line 32 runs every 60 second; Since the variable `run` is always True, and to the best of my knowledge can't turn False: the while loop will never stop. And in the first line of the while loop it has a sleep statement; That sleep statement has a variable which is set to 60 seconds; Does that make sense or am I missing some core concepts here?"
423,1548768987.9941,Leida,"the sleep() blocks the thread, this should not enable the other loop to run any further"
423,1548769026.9949,Conchita,"interesting. Well it does run for quite some time. Sometimes days, sometimes hours; hmmm"
423,1548769078.996,Leida,"my initial guess was that your second loop calls main again and that an error that causes it to stop would enable a write to the database, but i dont see that anywhere; do you call the script itself in a loop somewhere?"
423,1548769140.9966,Conchita,"I do not; The last loop in this script is a for loop which is  inside of a class I have, but that deals with sentiment analysis (textblob) and does not call this script"
423,1548769277.9977,Valeri,Yeah I got that; I was wondering what lead you into doing this; Maybe if you shared that we could have a better simpler solution?
423,1548769316.9986,Leida,did the last paste of code contain code from multiple sources?
423,1548769415.9988,Conchita,No; All the snippets have been from the same script
423,1548769729.0012,Leida,there is some magic going on that i dont see from the pastes but basically in the `start_stream()` there is an uncaught exception so that the while loop breaks and the global state does not get updated. Since there is a break statement in the successful running of `stream.filter()` means that something needs to call this bit of code over and over; what ever the exception is calling `stream.filter()` does not fix it; so i would assume the problem is with the authentication becoming invalid
423,1548770003.0047,Valeri,"<@Conchita> Why don't you allow your code to break and then figure out what went wrong?; Basically get rid of all the exceptions and see why your code broke; Also, relying on a exceptions to perform tasks is a bad idea imo"

423,1548770947.0132,Leida,3.4 does indeed have `async` 3.6 has `is_async`
423,1548771141.0133,Arturo,cool thanks!
423,1548771448.0151,Leida,ok so actually there is no exception to catch in `start_stream()` since it probably succeeds first time it is run and since `is_async` is `True` the `stream.filter()` is run on a separate thread; the library handles passing of data between threads internally; so now i guess the stream is terminated at some point or just blocked from getting any data and there is no exception to catch on the main thread; if this is so then the pasted lines of logging would correspond to times of restarting the script; so... the error should show up in `stream.listner` by the looks of the tweepy source code

I did a ton of research on ssh and figured out that you really can't run executables/batch files over ssh.; at least for windows. seems like linux users were able to get it going
429,1548780422.0431,Clemmie,"<@Nenita> that sounds unusual, can you point to resources explaining why? I didn’t think there would be a situation where an OS would differentiate between an “local” user and an ssh-ed user. Ultimately, at least in *nix they both login to the shell"
429,1548780552.0465,Nenita,"I can try. but i said that earlier because of testing. i got it working with putty, vm linux, as well as python, but when a script was run say - 'start .' it will execute the command, but nothing happens on either pc, mine or the remote pc.; but let me see if i can find solid sources from my findings; but also when running any script with 'start' at the beginning, putty just hangs; for how long? - don't know. seems forever."
429,1548780747.0492,Leida,"i've got an architecture problem to solve:
I async in udp packets and relay them to a consumer elsewhere. From the packet i need to update internal state to mirror the packet sender to build logic on top of the sender. Since the packets are UDP i cant use streams and have to go lower and implement a protocol. The loop.create_datagram_endpoint() takes a protocol factory. This means i cant hook it up with a connection to the state at init and have to find another method to pass the data.
Some of my ideas:
Create a protocol factory factory that creates the state sharing at init. Seems bit dumb.
Create a singleton via an internal state module that has a data sink method for the protocol to use and internal data parsing and what not and another public api for getting the current state. This could do the trick, but singleton...
Another idea was to try use rxpy as im familiar with rx on .NET. Havent figured out how to implement it asyncronously and not even sure it needs to be async and which version of the library to use...
Another dumb idea is to biggyback on the logging module and do the state mutation via that. Logging internally implements pub sub so it would work but at the cost of being clever with in built libraries that werent meant for that specific task.
One more idea is to be a good boy and get state out of the code as the functional way and instead write it to a data storage unit like sqlite or w/e and then create a second program to check the state and execute logic based on that. Since nothing needs to be done in the same second there is no timing constraints. A con is the data read and writes - i would rather have everything on ram. Some ram based database then?
Another idea is to make the protocol itself keep the state using what-are-they-called.. class variables? But holding the whole state in something that is a protocol for something else does just not feel right xD"
430,1548780940.0505,Clemmie,<@Leida> you might get more bites in <#C8W1XRJSE|architecture>
429,1548781015.0515,Leida,i was thinking the same but decided against it as the introduction of the channel mentioned trying not to post stuff that help could deal with; ill ask there later i guess ^^
429,1548781356.0523,Carmen,"Okay, so your biggest issue will be carrying over that data between requests. The best way is to just pass around the prediction model ID and always pull the full data from the database when you need it. If they need to modify things, present those fields to the user and use a fields whitelist for processing the update."

432,1548784646.0583,Cherilyn,Hello all. I have a newbie issue but I couldnt solve it. <https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/comments/al2mvq/cannot_create_a_new_instance_to_model/>?
432,1548784789.0594,Clemmie,Can you show the code for your `project_list` view?
432,1548784827.0604,Jonas,"<@Cherilyn>: is the model in the database?; you need to break down your problem. Is the problem that the model is not saved, or that the model is not displayed."
432,1548784866.0616,Carmen,"<@Nenita> Your main issue is that up until the past few years, Windows didn't really care about SSH, so it was all ad-hoc from third-party projects.

If you're using Windows 10 or up: <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/how-to-install-the-built-in-windows-10-openssh-server/>
If you're using older stuff: <https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guide_windows_openssh_server>"
432,1548784890.0622,Cherilyn,"yes, it is. I can add new instances in the admin panel"
432,1548784899.0626,Carmen,"That will get you an SSH shell, and then you just run your commands as per usual (with the obvious caveat that you aren't going to have your normal Linux command-line toolkit available)."
432,1548784912.0629,Hiroko,interesting.  thanks!
432,1548784935.0631,Jonas,"So the issue is not that you cannot create them, the issue is you cannot display them; so you need to update your question accordingly, and show different code?"
432,1548785002.0637,Nenita,can this be done without putty?
432,1548785007.0639,Jonas,"Just a tip, when you're asking a question online you need to make it as specific as possible. Something like ""models dont appear"" is too vague - there are lots of reasons why this could happen. You need to dig into *why* they don't appear, and ask more specific questions. Like, ""why is this model not being displayed even though it is in the database"""
432,1548785051.0645,Nenita,"nvm; just tried it. it works, but the same issue is still occuring. it just hangs when certain commands are run"
432,1548785152.0651,Cherilyn,"actually, the form that I am using the create new instances cannot do the job. I can only create instance via admin panel. Whenever I try to create new new projects via form, it does nothing and redirect me to project list page"
432,1548785192.0658,Nenita,"and for the commands that don't hang, i.e. opening a bat file - nothing happens still. odd."
432,1548785228.066,Jonas,"Ok, so ones created through the admin are displayed in the list?"
432,1548785235.0663,Nenita,im going to try wimrm; <@Leida> I am using windows only. most results seem to be for/with linux
432,1548785277.0676,Cherilyn,yes; It seems that form can not create new instances
432,1548785332.068,Jonas,`form.save()` returns the instance of the model it is saving; try inspecting the return value to see if it has an `.id`
432,1548786548.0684,Cherilyn,maybe it is a stupid question but how can I inspect return value?
433,1548787192.0701,Ashley,"<@Nenita> I'm coming in late and didn't read everything, but with SSH, you're basically operating entirely on the machine you ""SSH'd"" into. So when you SSH into a linux machine, you're limited to a linux environment, so you can't run .bat files, because those are windows only; also, if you write a .bat script that SSH's into a linux machine for you, it won't run the commands in the .bat script after the SSH command until after the SSH command is done running, which means killing the SSH connection"
432,1548787653.0717,Jonas,`print()` is the simplest :slightly_smiling_face:
433,1548787657.0719,Jonas,`print(form.save())`
432,1548788915.0724,Mozelle,"I can not find a way to load this json and then extract the app.service field. I have tried with a for loop or via pyjq and it will never find items[]

432,1548788987.0728,Jonas,You're piping to jq; you want to use `shell=True`; and make the entire thing a single string
432,1548789016.0738,Mozelle,I tried to just for loop the json but it fails
432,1548789027.0741,Jonas,you can't pipe to jq in the way you are doing; remove the `jq` bit and do it inside python perhaps

432,1548789626.0886,Mozelle,I thought json.loads treated it like a list so you could use the fields?
432,1548789634.089,Raven,"<@Nenita> SSH just executes commands as if they are being executed locally - it doesn't matter which SSH program you use, generally"
432,1548789644.0896,Carmen,Aha. I must have picked up the Ubuntu thing from somewhere else.; Are the commands you're trying to run GUI-based?

432,1548789756.0964,Nenita,<@Carmen> no just basic commands like 'start'

432,1548789812.0983,Mozelle,This is the output it has would items not be a field?
432,1548789817.0987,Nenita,basic commands that return data work perfectly like their suppose to. It just hangs with certain commands.
432,1548789839.0995,Cherish,"<@Nenita> one thing I did learn the hard way, SSH’ing into a Linux environment though (not Windows), is that this didn’t work to run commands that are aliases in the bash profile on the other machine; not sure if that might be what you’re running into"
432,1548789867.1004,Carmen,"<@Nenita> It honestly sounds like the system is trying to do the thing, but the SSH server doesn't have the appropriate permissions or capabilities to handle whatever the command is supposed to do."
432,1548789883.1009,Nenita,that is the only option i have left to conclude; i was reading that on one post; <@Carmen>
432,1548789917.1021,Carmen,"In Linux, I'd think it was related to not having a Windowing system like X available, but I'm not sure how Windows environments handle that sort of thing."

432,1548789949.1039,Nenita,"i think a good option to wing out is to test out ssh from linux to windows and see if these commands execute on my own pc through vm; if it works through vm to my pc, then its concluded that it may be permission based"

432,1548790327.1111,Carmen,"Well, you said you were wanting to test if the commands affect the remote PC. That would let you know that you can affect it. If you need to interact with specific programs in specific ways, that's a whole different ballgame."
432,1548790340.1118,Raven,"Usually `start` will execute a program in a different window. If you're in an SSH session, you won't see that other window."

432,1548790396.1142,Carmen,"It's been years. Let me grab my Grey Hat Python book and see what he uses, and go from there."
432,1548790433.1149,Kiera,"<@Mozelle> the issue is that the key you put in between the `[…]` braces is a python expression.  You're giving an expression of `items` - which means to look up the name `items` in the current symbol table and find the value associated with it.  You haven't defined any name `items`, so it's telling you that the name `items` is not found.  To look up a literal string value as a key, you need to give it a literal string - surrounded by quotes (e.g. `'…'` or `""…""`); so specifically, you should be looking for `test[""items""]`"

435,1548793398.1262,Granville,Does anyone know if there's a point where you would use a nested function over a class?
435,1548793700.1265,Ashley,decorators; classes are good for when you need to keep track of the state of some data and need functionality that's dependent on that data's state
435,1548793848.1289,Hiroko,Or if you want a custom handler for a callback.  Like in the pybreaker circuit breaker library 
435,1548793867.1291,Ashley,that too; sometimes you just want the ability to create a one-off function that you can change a little bit about without going through the hassle of making a class with callable instances
435,1548793964.1306,Raven,"I would argue that unless you explicitly have a package of state _and_ operations that operate primarily on that state alone, you shouldn't have a class; I think Java has a lot to answer for, with the ""everything should be a class"" attitude it created"

435,1548794617.1368,Raven,I think that's another good point - nested functions (and classes) mean you can avoid polluting the global namespace with things that aren't going to get used outside of a specific context
435,1548794654.1376,Hiroko,"precisely, and for my purposes, that’s pretty much the primary usage"
435,1548794665.1381,Carmen,"True, but isn't that what namespaces in general are supposed to handle?"
435,1548794689.139,Hiroko,"I use inheritance and composition alot, which means mixins and base classes.  and this usage pattern tends to clean things up a bit more and increase understandability"
435,1548794703.1393,Carmen,"I was trying to come up with an equivalent of ""related function aggregation"" as per Scala objects, but really, namespaces should do that AFAIK."

Is there something I need to type before the name of the doc?
435,1548795273.1414,Hiroko,would help to see what you’re doing

435,1548795307.142,Sylvie,It's line 15
435,1548795356.1427,Gemma,either make sure you're in the directory that the html file exists or `open()` the absolute path to the file

435,1548795571.1479,Sylvie,I took the path from the error and plopped it in there and it's throwing more errors :expressionless:
435,1548795598.1484,Jonas,I would take a look at some of the suggestions above and see if they help
435,1548795599.1485,Raven,Show the errors; (and the new code)
435,1548795615.1489,Sylvie,I'm trying them as much as I can; I'm looking where I can add the suggestions
435,1548795642.1497,Jonas,"Your code is running in the wrong directory. Have a look for an input box called ""working directory"" inside visual studio code"

435,1548795706.1511,Ashley,it looks like vs code
435,1548795727.1514,Raven,"Right; That error is saying that it's confused about your string used for a path name... it probably has a `\u` in it (e.g. `\users`) and that starts to look like a special Unicode character, to Python"
435,1548795766.1527,Sylvie,It seems like it looks at the path error and just quits the code.
435,1548795771.1528,Raven,"Swap the backslashes `\` for forward slashes `/` and try again; Yes, it will stop as soon as it hits the first error.; (There's some other way to get Python to ignore the backslashes, but I forget what it is. Perhaps an `r` prefix. Maybe someone else can comment?)"
435,1548795858.1542,Sylvie,So switching from \ to / fixed it.
435,1548795871.1545,Raven,cool

435,1548802476.1599,Roxanne,That was the underlying question; <@Gemma> ty !
435,1548802491.1605,Gemma,so `A().foo` will work but `A().foo = 2` shouldn't

437,1548807382.1704,Jonas,"`something, something2 = a.foo['x'], a.foo['y']`; so you're calling `foo` twice and creating two large dictionaries only to throw them away"
437,1548807407.1712,Genesis,"ya, I would find it very very weird, for me, that `a.foo != a.foo`; why make it a property and not just a method?"
437,1548807435.1719,Jonas,"If foo returns the *same* object, then it's true"
437,1548807460.1725,Genesis,`a.foo is not a.foo`?

Prior to that I *thought* I had planned for every specific exception but naah hehe; This tool will also be used for low-traffic keywords in short timeframes (each minute) so receiving zero value entries will be a common occurrence. What could be done is catching deviations maybe? Or track the time since the data changed value?

Don't have the tree trunk to connect the branches and leaves on; What do you recommend me to do to figure this out?

Should I read upon `async` and if so any specifics OR is that a rathole better avoided for a beginner like me (you hinted to this last night)

445,1548831430.1903,Riva,Hi friends..; Do you have any idea to create windows Application to select list of pdf files and display all files on application.
445,1548831800.1922,Sasha,Is there any particular reason you want to build this? There are a zillion PDF readers for Windows.
445,1548832249.1928,Riva,I dont know my manager gave this task to develop that application
445,1548832325.1943,Sasha,Great! Install Acrobat and tell him you made it.  :wink:
445,1548832348.1946,Riva,actually if one pdf contain 100 above pages then by using we can select particular pages and make it into another pdf are give to print option; Nice joke
445,1548832763.1954,Carmen,<@Riva> So you just want to combine all the PDFs into a single PDF for display and possible printing?
445,1548832907.196,Riva,yes
445,1548832913.1963,Carmen,"With page selection options, it looks like."
445,1548832918.1965,Riva,In windows application
445,1548833007.1979,Carmen,Look at the PyPDF2 library.; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/17304537>

445,1548833086.1998,Carmen,"For your page selection portion, however, you'll probably need to break out into the actual PDFReader and PDFWriter classes, displaying which pages in which PDF should or shouldn't be included in the final PDF and acting accordingly."
445,1548833138.2011,Riva,Actually this entire process has to be develop in windows application using GUI
445,1548833268.2038,Carmen,You're still going to need something underneath the GUI to do the PDF merging.
445,1548833318.2049,Riva,yeah but i didn't get any solution to develop
445,1548833341.2062,Carmen,<https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html> Pick one that works for Windows and use it to build your GUI according to whatever specs you have.
445,1548833368.2067,Riva,by using PySimpleGUI i am able to display the selected pdf.; But i want to display the list of pages in sidebar
445,1548833537.2091,Leida,<@Nenita> Any luck with your SSH endeavours? The answer i posted should help you. With SSH you log in to the windows machine so even the linux to windows examples are valid - you are running the actual commands on the windows machine. You say that opening a folder does not work but SSH is not a GUI enabled system by default. If you try to open something like file explorer then it wont show on the screen of the windows machine because it is opened in the background by a user that has no GUI. To really open a folder you use `cd` which works on both windows and linux. If you really need to open some graphical interfaces you are better off with loging in  to the machine with RDP or some tool like TeamViewer. And if you are hell bent on SSH to do work with GUI tools you need to set the gui to run with in a user that has access to GUI and set the correct access rights and accept eula and what not. The answers you find that SSH from linux should work exactly the same as SSH from windows to windows. Unless there is mention of X server - then its linux specific xD
445,1548833684.2094,Riva,Ok thank you

447,1548844802.2131,Elene,hi <@Shena> Do you already have a working application with python gui?; If you want to display list of pages as in previews in your sidebar then you'll probably need something like thumbnails which can be scrolled through

451,1548859673.2471,Carmen,"Yeah, so looking at a few examples randomly grabbed from the site, the URL has an ID in the path, and that's sufficient for pulling up the listing, so it's their unique identifier for the listing.; Example: <https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-M393B2G70AH0-YH9-16Gb-2Rx4-PC3L-10600R-DDR3-1333MHz-ECC-Server-Memory/192805094956?hash=item2ce414462c:g:CpQAAOSw~sJcJp3R>; If you remove the hash query parameter, no harm no foul.; If you remove the `Samsung-M393B2G70AH0-YH9-16Gb-2Rx4-PC3L-10600R-DDR3-1333MHz-ECC-Server-Memory/` portion, it still loads the listing.; But if you remove the `/192805094956` portion, it fails to find the listing.; Of course, if you *only* have the titles, and you don't have access to the URLs, that doesn't really help much, and you're back to hashing."
451,1548859898.2485,Elene,"I have 2 entries, but that’s because the timestamps are unique, if you wish you can completely ignore the milliseconds; ```

unique(event_time,event_user,event_id)

451,1548860111.2494,Bernita,"<@Carmen> how I scrape now is that i dont dive into each ad; this is superfast, but does not give my unique stuff since i dont request and dive"
451,1548860183.2498,Carmen,You shouldn't need to dive into the ad itself to pull the URL. Wherever you're scraping the title from should also have the URL.
451,1548860287.25,Bernita,"Oke, your right. I see it now in the html; hashing the title is what i was doing now. but this could skip the hash step"

454,1548862031.2526,Randal,"Hello everyone. I'm new here and also a bit of a newbie to coding in general. I'm wondering if anyone can help me with my project.

I'm trying to run my first website using Flask and storing user information with Flask-sqlalchemy.

When I run my script the website works perfectly fine. The user can go to the correct page and input some data which appears to save to a database as it holds all the information and prints it out to the user each time they submit something.

However it does not create a .db file in the directory on pycharm so I cant actually find the database. What am I missing?

Thanks in advance; Not appearing in directory folder on the left hand side in pycharm when script it run"
454,1548862166.2533,Jonas,This is a common issue with PyCharm; when you run your app it is likely running it in a different directory. If you select the 'website' run from the top-right dropdown and edit it; check the `working directory` option and ensure it is pointing to the path of your project
454,1548862378.2551,Randal,Yes it is pointing to the correct directory; None
454,1548862782.2559,Jonas,"You may have an extra slash in your path. Try `<sqlite://sqlite.db>`?; not 100% sure, but it might be creating the file in `/sqlite.db`"
455,1548863782.2569,Leida,i think documentation says that you use 3 slashes for relative bath and 4? for absolute; so the question should be what is it relative to
454,1548863808.2576,Leida,or you could just give it absolute path in the first place
455,1548864420.2578,Randal,"So I changed it to the absolute path(well I think this is right). And it created the file for me. Thats so strange. Thanks guys, literally taken me 5 hours just to find the right answer.. How could I create the file in the same directory without using the absolute path?"

455,1548866372.2644,Leida,<@Randal> you could give it a unique name and try some find utility to try and find it on your harddrive; if you know where it ends up on your drive could give a hint why it gets there

456,1548867459.2681,Harris,I'm looking for an elegant syntax for creating a task from each result from a previous task; My assumption was that map was used for this purpose
456,1548867497.269,Hiroko,"what about chain?; &gt;&gt;&gt;The linked task will be applied with the result of its parent task as the first argument. In the above case where the result was 64, this will result in mul(4, 16)."
456,1548867512.2699,Harris,"chain would create one task from the prior result; I want to create a group of tasks, one for each result"

457,1548876069.2755,Carrol,what are you using to run the command? `subprocess`?

457,1548876341.2788,Selene,could you just do `os.environ['POSTGRES_PASSWORD']='something'` and then unset it right after?
457,1548876363.2791,Carrol,"you can pass a `env` to `Popen`

458,1548881070.283,Hiroko,"so, `**` means you’re unpacking the kwargs into a dict; so, antthing like `func_1(boat, car, some_param=2o378, ...)`

anything after `car` that is named will be packed into a `kwarg` dict`; now, a single * will pack un-named arguments into a tuple"
458,1548881902.2856,Granville,"hmm. I mean, I could do something like this to reach the args of my function2:; None; My actual code has the functions set for one to call another, not exactly the nested way, but the first function changes its output in a way before going into a second function and I don't see a way of modifying the args of that second function without passing the variables thru the first function if that makes sense"
458,1548882182.2887,Clemmie,Showing your actual code would help.; It is hard to debug from a stub and an explanation that the actual code is different

458,1548883301.296,Clemmie,"<@Granville> if you know what the flag needs to be then use `return rest_endpoint(rest_endpoint[1]+code, True)` or whatever the flag is. If on the other hand the flag will be passed to `get_zoningdata` then use
```
def get_zoningdata(code='', **kwargs):

458,1548883401.2971,Granville,<@Clemmie> Thanks. I'll opt for the `**kwargs` way because these functions are part of a module I'm building

458,1548883818.3005,Clemmie,"<@Candi> That is saying that `x` is a float. I would get rid of the `if..startswith` clause and just `print(x)` to actually see what value you are trying to manipulate. You say you expect names and ebsites, but a float is a number…so something is off"

458,1548884024.3017,Clemmie,"Really? there should be at least one that is a number; Ok, if the names are mostly good you can do `if str(x).startswith('http'):` (You don’t need the true, startswith evaluates as a boolean)"

458,1548884439.3074,Candi,"<@Sparkle> can you explain what this means if re.search('^(https?|www\.)', string); i am beginner"
458,1548884463.308,Sparkle,"it just means check if the string starts with either `http`, `https` or `www.`  the period is escaped because otherwise `.` matches any character but `\.` matches literal period"
458,1548884496.3085,Candi,oh cool
458,1548884521.3093,Sparkle,`https?` the `?` makes the `s` conditional - to shorten it from writing out both
458,1548884530.3097,Candi,and how to check for urls such as <http://amazon.com|amazon.com> or <http://amazon.uk|amazon.uk>
458,1548884660.3118,Sparkle,"i mean you can pass a general pattern to hopefully catch most cases - basically `\S+\.[A-Za-z]{2,3}`  usually url regex are more robust - but in the interest of not needing to know about all edge cases and just wanting to flag if the string looks like it might be a url - `\S+` means any consecutive non-spaces, then a literal `.` followed by ether `2 or 3 letters`"
458,1548884678.3124,Claudine,REGEX YOU SAY!?!?!?!
458,1548884683.3127,Sparkle,"so even if its `.<http://co.uk|co.uk>` it would still ring true for `non spaced char, followed by 2 or 3` characters; you could couple both patterns into: ```if re.search('(^(https?|www\.)|\S+\.[A-Za-z]{2,3})', string)``` to check for either of those cases `|` meaning “or”"
458,1548885129.3151,Candi,wow just 1 statement can check for all the cases thats awesome

458,1548886473.3222,Marth,"<@Candi> I might be misunderstanding your dataset, but perhaps you can do this with pandas directly (instead of the for/if loop) ?
Since 'data' is the name of your dataframe...something like this might work:  `data[data.name.str.startswith('http')]`
""name"" is whatever the column you want to search is called.  So if it's called ""company"" just replace `name` with `company`"

462,1548892898.3326,Carmen,"Possibly because if you expand all of the keys in a dict ala `.format(**vardic)`, you're going to get key errors if there are additional keys within the dict that aren't in the string.

But error is coming.; 'traj.txt' file saving (x,y) position for both variables after that, But Output is not showing. Problem is, How both variables will be called at the same time?"
468,1548919371.3478,Sasha,Can you chain two `fx` calls? Like `blur1 = clip.fx(... traj1 ...)` and `blur2 = blur1.fx(... traj2 ...)`?
468,1548919709.35,Winona,"Oh, Yeah It's working now. Thanks. But It's for only 2 objects.
How I can use it for more than 3 or more objects at the same time.  ??"
468,1548919985.3516,Sasha,"You should be able to loop over as many objects as you want. Just use `trajs = Trajectory.load_list('traj.txt')` and you should be able to refer to the different paths as `trajs[0]`, etc."

468,1548921182.3551,Sasha,It looks weird that your `guess` has only 2 elements... I would have expected 6.
470,1548921400.3552,Leida,I dont know what your end goal is. If its just to scrape the data and not go much into learning python or programming in general then as is is probably fine.
469,1548921401.3554,Doretha,"Ahh. So i tried running it again with 6 elements, still i get the same error."
468,1548921514.3556,Sasha,"I suspect something is wrong with your matrix axes, that the `dot` call wants a 1x6 instead of a 6x1 or something. I'd start printing out some of your intermediate results in the loop and see if they have the right dimensions."
468,1548921576.3565,Winona,Solved issue. Thanks <@Valeri> &amp; <@Sasha> :taco::taco:
468,1548921774.3566,Leida,"Your code dips into using threads. Threads are like different dimensions for data processing. In one the data grabbing is done, in the other the processing and saving. The problem with threads is passing data between them. You can have problems where two different threads try to write or read the same data and the outcome is never good. For you the library you use is pretty good and hides those problems from you. So in general you dont need to know much about threads to get the job done. The magic i was looking for is exactly that it seemed there to be code that would take the whole thread to do work and not allow the other part to work but somehow it did. Reading about the library in use cleared my confusion - there is a separate thread for its work.; It seems to me that the stream not only returns you the values it grabbed off twitter but also sends you all the errors that happend on the other thread. For debugging you should figure out how to read the errors the stream sends you. Your solution of simply restarting the stream may well be the only option even if you knew what the error was. Only problem is that you try to reconnect for ever even if the error is that you no longer have internet connection or something similar."

474,1548949179.3759,Carmen,"If you want to capture the output as well as print it, you'll need to either get a file-type object that you can pass into pipe that will store and print at the same time, or you'll need to be regularly printing the file object you passed as the stdout."

I’ve set up my version of an exercism exercise to translate age into different second values on different planets. I want my class to interpret the user data and change the value based on that. Conceptually I’m lost, if anyone could weigh in with some explanation, that would be awesome. Thank you."
474,1548954255.3772,Hiroko,"so, the first bit, `class SpaceAge`; the parameter for that is for anything that class should inherit from a parent class; lets say you have

```class Shape(object):
    # methods here

class Circle(Shape):
    # methods here that can ovveride methods in Shape
```; so, lets say you want to have a method `area` in `Shape

```class Shape(object):
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError('Shape doesn't define a default implementation of area')

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, diameter):
         self.diameter = diameter
    def area(self):
        return (math.pi / 4) * math.pow(self.diameter, 2)
```; so, you can do ```s = Shape()```; but if you do `s.area()`, you’ll get your error, because it explifictly raises the not implemented error; however, if you do ```c = Circle(2947)
c.area()  # outputs 6821033.038```; so, for your example, you can remove `e_seconds` from `SpaceAge`; its already a parameter for your init, so you pass it in like

```s_a = SpaceAge(8376456)
s_a.jupiter()  # calls the method
```; but with your existing definiton, it doesn’t do anything; remember, methods have scope.  so if you’re defining a variable inside a method, that method isn’t available outside.  so, calling `jupiter` above just has `j_seconds` available inside that method with no way to access it; because you haven’t done `return seconds * 11.862615`"

474,1548955307.3902,Leopoldo,lol thank you
474,1548955314.3905,Hiroko,"what might help is to think of `class ...` as a blueprint; it contains the stuff to create the thing you want and the behavior you deem necessary; and instances, eg, `c = SpaceAge(...)`, just follow that blueprint"
474,1548955472.3927,Leopoldo,Could you make it even simpler for me. What goes in the first parenthesis of Class SpaceAge(?); And where does that (?) need to be defined?
474,1548955578.394,Hiroko,"it defines what things that class should have by default; if nothing is specified, or the params are omitted, it just inherits from `object`, which is the base python class; look at my example above with Shape and Circle; we want Circle to have the properties of Shape, because a circle is a shape, right?; it has area, boundaries, color, etc; so you can define those properties in Shape, and have Circle say “hey, no need to rewrite all that code, I can just pull it in for myself”"
474,1548955742.3969,Leopoldo,Hmm ok that makes sense.
474,1548955770.3975,Hiroko,"so, each class has a constructor, and in puython, thats the `__init__(self)` method; now, `self` is an explicit way for you to refer to a specific instance of a class"

477,1548955940.4005,Leopoldo,thank you <@Clemmie> I will read this as well
474,1548956038.4013,Leopoldo,ok <@Hiroko> makes sense. I get a little confused where things are being defined and where to apply those.; But I’m getting a little more of an understanding.
474,1548956195.4043,Carmen,"To be slightly more explicit about the the first line of the class definition, `class SpaceAge(?)`, putting something where the `?` is is optional. That slot is where you say, ""This class that I'm defining inherits it's methods and attributes from this other class"". It's a way to reuse code without having to violate the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). By inheriting from another class, you can rely on that class to define everything it does, and then you just modify the things that you need to act differently in yours.; You can inherit from multiple other classes, just separating those class names from each other with a comma, and it will give you all the attributes and methods from each of them.; If you don't inherit from another class explicitly, the system will say your class inherits from the built-in Object class."
474,1548956299.407,Leopoldo,That is really helpful <@Carmen> I wouldn’t enter anything there unless I want it inherited from another class
474,1548956304.4072,Carmen,Precisely.
474,1548956359.4086,Leopoldo,Can I inherit a value from a variable? Like my e_seconds? Or would I need to create another class with that value?
474,1548956409.4093,Hiroko,you can inherit from classes or methods
474,1548956410.4094,Carmen,"No, because your variable is not a class. It's an instance of a class (in your case, an integer)."
474,1548956427.4102,Hiroko,but that;s a distinction that really doesn’t matter at this point
474,1548956433.4105,Carmen,"Ooo, method inheritance is something new for me. *Googles*"
474,1548956439.4107,Hiroko,look for mixins

474,1548956477.4114,Carmen,"Oooooh, you're talking about overriding previously defined methods, yes?"
474,1548956499.4117,Hiroko,or adding in new ones that really don’t belong to a specific class
474,1548956523.4122,Carmen,"Aha. Then yes, I'm familiar with that. I just hadn't ever heard of it described as inheriting from a method."
474,1548956533.4124,Hiroko,"ah, gotcha; you can do it both, from class or from method"
474,1548956615.413,Carmen,Can you toss me an example link? My google-fu isn't coming up with what I think you're talking about.

485,1548970320.4501,Lamonica,"<@Clemmie> well, that looks great! Thanks :) :taco:

Yes, they just return True/False yet, but I rewrite it."
485,1548970322.4502,Clemmie,"None; Or change return signatures , sure"
485,1548970603.4531,Sasha,I've sometimes used the pattern `okay = func1(); okay = okay and func2();` etc. to use the boolean technique while still keeping each one on a different un-nested line.
485,1548970740.4546,Clemmie,"You could also do
```
funcs = [func1, func2, func3]
for func in funcs:
   f = func()
   if not f:
      break
```; or even better
```
funcs = [func1, func2, func3]

   if not func():
      break

485,1548970873.4578,Sasha,Actually does `all()` do the right thing?
485,1548970963.4603,Clemmie,"Looks like it will, but not obvious that you can use it for flow control of run subsequent if earlier is True"
485,1548970990.4616,Sasha,"Yeah, I don't remember whether it short-circuits or not."
485,1548970991.4617,Clemmie,"Though all() does appear to stop flow when it encounters False, so it would work"
485,1548970994.462,Franklin,"<@Clemmie>, I like the latter proposal. If all arguments are identical (or there are no)
And this is a good candidate for a separate function, as for me (similar to `all`)"
485,1548971005.4624,Clemmie,at least according to the `equivalent to` section of the docs; <@Franklin> You can even handle non-identical method signatures by having well crafted **kwargs passed
485,1548971097.4643,Franklin,"hm, could you give an example please?"
485,1548971265.4645,Clemmie,None
485,1548971363.4652,Franklin,pretty cool! thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
485,1548971379.4656,Clemmie,"Sorry, also need to catch `**kwargs` in the function definitions, editing"

491,1549009305.5029,Jimmy,if you need to insert stuff between `'` you can replace that with more text that are also between `'`

494,1549025798.5362,Randal,"I'm a beginner. I've done a few projects, lots of imports but Its my first time working with flask and SQLalchemy. This is the first time i'm experiencing such issues"
494,1549025825.5368,Geneva,"Well, I normally run django (with gunicorn) + celery as supervisor demons to serve my app backend on AWS. but since today, without any code changes the celery just wont start. Tried reinstalling it with pip, but no luck. It gives literally 0 output to console, just hangs after the command execution"
495,1549025923.5369,Randal,Now its working..?
494,1549026107.538,Hiroko,<@Geneva> have you added `DEBUG=True` to your celery config?

494,1549026249.5413,Geneva,"nothing, not even message about it starting, but when i intentionally make a typo in app name, it gives me the stack trace, so it shouldn't be a sys issue"
494,1549026415.5415,Hiroko,what version celery?
494,1549026575.5417,Geneva,latest - 4.2.1
494,1549026634.5419,Hiroko,"you’re on AWS, right?"
494,1549026645.5424,Geneva,yes
494,1549026649.5425,Hiroko,could your workers be rate limited if you’re on burst instances?
494,1549026740.5439,Geneva,"Im very new to AWS, (been using IBM cloud until now) . I've just created micro instance where it runs, and based on monitoring for last day, cpu utilization was max at 30% , so I thought this wouldnt be instance issue :confused:"
494,1549026754.5445,Hiroko,"it very well may be; but if your on T2 instances, you accrue cpu credits if your instance works under a certain load, and spend cpu credits if it goes above that; and with your cpu utilization over the past day, I believe your balance would be spent, which would cap your cpu at 1/10 of normal; that’s one of the things you have to be aware of when using “burstable” instances; they’re alot like a sprinter, can go all out over short distanes but would move fairly slowly over a marathon"
494,1549026940.5478,Geneva,"But I dont think this looks like what you are describing tbh, but I may be wrong"
494,1549026968.5487,Hiroko,"huh, from your description, I’d expect the cpu credits to be much lower; or to zero"
494,1549027029.5495,Geneva,"yup, thats why im saying it doesnt look like that"
494,1549027142.5499,Hiroko,what OS are you running on?; and when you do `ps aux | grep -i celery` are there any other processes running?
494,1549027284.5506,Geneva,"I am using the linux AMI , which is basicaly a RHEL; and no, when I grep for celery, I only see the command i ran that hangs and the grep itself"
494,1549027464.5517,Hiroko,"can you show your daemon config?; you’re using systemd, right?"
494,1549027590.5526,Geneva,"supervisord; but i canceled the demonization now, killed all processes and tried it by hand, so it shouldnt be demonization issue"
497,1549034935.5567,Granville,Does anyone know if setting blank variables in functions would cause cases to fail when I'm passing in actual information during my function calls? I can provide an example if need be.
497,1549035242.5577,Clemmie,Please do provide examples. It is not completely obvious what you are asking
497,1549035250.5579,Granville,Certainly
497,1549035674.5585,Agustina,"you mean something like this?
```
def name(param=''):
  pass
```"
497,1549035763.5592,Granville,"So for some reason, when I run this, my output continues to fail on the first case with the function call at the bottom"
497,1549035806.5595,Agustina,"I would think a better solution would be:
```
def name(param=None):
  if param == None:
    param = ''
  # Do something else here
```"
497,1549035940.5604,Hiroko,"well, an empty string is evaluated to `False"
497,1549036061.5611,Agustina,"with this example, you should get back `{'Year': '2012'}`, right?"
497,1549036074.5615,Granville,Correct
497,1549036081.5618,Agustina,so what are you actually getting?
497,1549036091.5622,Ashley,"also, for optional arguments, `None` is recommended instead of a blank string as the default value; also, it returns `{'Year': '2012', 'code': ''}`"
497,1549036130.5627,Granville,"{'Year': '2012', 'code': ''}"
497,1549036145.563,Ashley,the reason being `combined=calyear.update(prgmcode)`
497,1549036146.5631,Agustina,"And never use empty objects (i.e. [], {}, etc.) as you won’t get what you expect because they’re passed by reference!"
497,1549036182.5642,Ashley,it updates the `calyear` dict to also have the stuff from `prgmcode`
497,1549036229.565,Granville,"<@Ashley> I see that part, but wouldn't the return fail on the first `if` statement and return nothing?"
497,1549036246.5651,Ashley,"to put that in other words, they can be mutable types, and the default value is hardcoded by reference, so it's the same `[]` object every time you call that function; nope"
497,1549036260.5657,Hiroko,"no, because you have an `else`"
497,1549036267.5663,Ashley,because `year` isn't Falsey
497,1549036268.5664,Hiroko,that’s a catch-all in case all others fail
497,1549036272.5666,Granville,"ah, so I have it backwards then"
497,1549036289.5669,Ashley,it returns from `elif not code:`
497,1549036318.5676,Agustina,he’s saying that the calyear variable content are updated IN PLACE… it doesn’t return a new value like an immutable object does.
497,1549036328.5678,Ashley,^
497,1549036348.5683,Agustina,"so the `if` conditions are working fine, but the object you’re returning has been changed"
497,1549036382.5685,Ashley,"technically, it returns `None` from `update`; because everything returns `None` by default; so `combined` is `None`"
497,1549036450.5697,Agustina,"true, so the value of `combined` is None, but the value of `calyear` has been changed by the update method call.."
497,1549036492.5702,Ashley,correct
497,1549036496.5704,Agustina,"I missed that when I first read the sample code, good catch <@Ashley>"
497,1549036501.5705,Ashley,"sorry, didn't mean to mislead; also, for styling notes, you should put spaces around the `=` when assigning to a variable, but not when passing or defining keyword arguments to/for a function; <@Granville> is this Python 3?"
497,1549036717.5718,Granville,<@Ashley> it is
497,1549036724.572,Ashley,"cool, one sec"
497,1549036768.5728,Granville,"thanks all. I'll take a look at this a bit further. I've never done something this way, so I may need to go back and do some tweaking until I get things right"
497,1549036906.5731,Ashley,"<@Granville> here's a fixed up version. Take a look at the `**` operator. You can probably use it to eliminate this function entirely; the `*` and `**` operators are also super handy in general, so you'll benefit from learning them; forr what to google, you can look for ""packing"" and ""unpacking"""
497,1549037298.575,Granville,"<@Ashley> Thanks! Ah, I was supposed to have a return regardless."
497,1549037418.5761,Ashley,"<@Granville> usually if the only thing that would go in your `else` is just a `return`, you don't need the else, and can just put it in normally"
497,1549037451.5768,Agustina,except that str(None) is ‘None’ so your variables will ALWAYS be populated.
497,1549037478.5771,Ashley,`year` won't be; or `code`; they'd both still be `None`
497,1549037529.5782,Agustina,"ah… sorry, you’re right… I need to stop switching languages and drink more coffee…"
497,1549037661.5783,Ashley,"However, you did make me think of a better approach"
497,1549037722.5788,Agustina,I like it… easier to read.
497,1549037830.5794,Chester,"You can also consider to return an empty dictionary instead of `None` if `year` and `code` aren't specified; So this snippet is simplified to just
```
def queries(year=None, code=None):
    response = {}
    if year:
        respone[""Year""] = str(year)
    if code:
        respone[""code""] = str(code)
    return response
```"
497,1549037860.5805,Ashley,"<@Chester> yeah, that would be better. It's still falsey and has a consistent data type; also less code"
497,1549037978.5826,Micki,Any help for the state transitions
497,1549037984.5827,Chester,"Also raises the question why do you need this as a function :slightly_smiling_face: It's pretty dumb (in its current form) to hide some complexity (there is no complexity in there), you probably won't use it for code reuse"
497,1549038053.5834,Agustina,unless this was just an except from a larger function to discuss this piece of the logic
497,1549038149.5839,Ashley,"yeah, that's why I was thinking `**` could pretty much nullify the need for the function"
498,1549040110.5875,Britt,"Hi all, how could I best iterate through a list of regex's to format a string (when/if it get's to the correct corresponding pattern) and also raise an error if none of the regex patterns match; None"
498,1549040651.5879,Clemmie,<@Britt>
499,1549041036.5884,Sasha,"Let's consider the string `""A\nB""`. In memory, this is three bytes: `0x41, 0x0A, 0x42`, or `A`, `linefeed`, `B`. But it would be awkward to have to hit return in the middle of typing it, so Python allows you to type `\n` in your source code instead in order to get that linefeed character. And if you ask for the `repr()` of that string variable, it will back-convert the `0x0A` byte to `""\n""` in printing it out. If you just `print()` the string, though, it'll give you a real linefeed and put the `B` on the following line.; Since Python has those escaping rules involving the backslash, if you want an actual backslash character in your string, you would ordinarily use `""\\""` in your code, which is just one character in memory, and prints out as just `\`. Though again, if you ask for the `repr()` form of the string, Python will back-convert to `""\\""` since `repr()` is supposed to be the source-code form of the string, basically. So if you want a literal `\*`, two characters, you should have `""\\*""` in your source code.; What you have now works only because there is no defined `\*` escape sequence, so Python just says, ""Oh, he probably just meant a literal backslash in this case."" However, when it gives you back the `repr()` form, it gives you the more proper source-code format, `""\\*""`. Got it?"
499,1549041661.5892,Granville,thanks all
500,1549048000.5928,Gayla,"Hi guys, not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I've been building a pretty simple web app in Flask most of today, it's a weight tracker app. It talks to postgres db and I'm using sqlalchemy. I'm having a massive problem displaying the data in my database back to the user in the web app. I'm planning on working on it most of tomorrow too, but this is a bit of a roadblock at the moment. Is anyone around to potentially lend a helping hand? I know what I want to do, and the code is pretty simple so I'm sure it won't be hard for someone to find the answer quickly."
500,1549048076.5932,Hiroko,"you could ask here, and we also have a <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel as well; is the problem with your db, api or frontend?"
500,1549048565.5951,Gayla,"Oh cool, let me get into that channel too. I am struggling with the syntax/code of querying the database to return all the rows in the db. And then I just want to simply display these results in a simple results page for the user. It's 3 columns, Date, Stone, Pounds (it's a weight tracker app).; How do I join the flask channel?; I've got everything set up and working in terms of db connections etc. I just don't know how to query the db, return all results and then display that to the user."

501,1549054834.5994,Darlene,"I'm using a dictionary to store classifiers in memory on an API so I don't need to download and unpickle each classifier on use. This takes up about 1 GB in RAM.
I am hoping to reduce this if possible. Anyone have any ideas?"
501,1549054999.6,Bethany,What kind of classifiers are they?; And how many
501,1549055467.601,Darlene,"classifying text, so I have vectorizers and classifiers.. and 12"
501,1549055509.6012,Bethany,is the dictionary for the vectorizers loaded into RAM?
501,1549055519.6014,Darlene,yes
501,1549055564.6016,Bethany,hm
501,1549055577.6018,Darlene,"```vectorizers[f] = vectorizer
classifiers[f] = classifier```; for each vectorizer/classifier"
501,1549055596.6022,Bethany,and you don't reuse vectorizer?; across classifiers
501,1549055707.6026,Darlene,they are all different unfortunately
501,1549055735.6028,Bethany,So it seems like you either need to do something like have a LR; have LRU cache for the model objects or separate them out into their own services; then only load `n` models at a time
501,1549056056.6034,Darlene,"no clue what LRU caching is or LR, I will do some research"
501,1549056103.6036,Bethany,"like load it up when it's needed, and keep in RAM until something else is needed"
501,1549056463.6042,Darlene,Every classifier is used for each request.. it seems like LRU would be better suited if I was only calling specific classifiers
501,1549056484.6044,Bethany,yeah that's True; well if you want all the classifiers to fire on each request I don't see too much choice
501,1549056512.6048,Darlene,ya. I'm at a loss
501,1549056530.6051,Bethany,what libraries did you use to mamke the classifier
501,1549056692.6053,Darlene,RandomForrest I believe (is this what you wanted to know)? Or scikit-learn?
501,1549056702.6055,Bethany,scikit-learn
501,1549056709.6057,Darlene,"I didn't make the classifiers, but I can only assume"
501,1549056727.6059,Bethany,how much RAM is due to vectorizers and how much is due to classifiers
501,1549056771.6061,Darlene,is there a good way to check this? they are loaded from the same pickled file; I come from ruby.. so performance wasn't my forte
501,1549056840.6065,Bethany,"try loading the model, then pickling the classifiers and vectorizers independently; Is the problem you don't want to have a server with 1GB sitting around doing nothing?"
501,1549056910.6069,Darlene,We are running on Heroku.. and 2GB servers start at $250
501,1549056969.6072,Bethany,how often is the API called for these models?
501,1549057015.6074,Darlene,"a single API call is made at a time one after another, from 2am - 5am I believe.."
501,1549057124.6076,Bethany,"are these models `sklearn.pipeline([sklearn.dictVectorizer, sklearn.RandomForestClassifier])`; I can think of two possibilities that are just different approaches - 1) factor out the vectorizers and use only one 2) Reformulate the problem to have 1 classifier with multilable output"
501,1549057336.6081,Darlene,"1) This may be an option, I am going to bring it up. 2) I've already tried to suggest this, but the classifier performed much worse"
501,1549057393.6083,Bethany,The other thing I could possibly think to do is to serve the model as a serverless function (aws lambda). If it's not being constantly invoked could save a lot
501,1549057572.6087,Darlene,I appreciate your help; I'm going to think over all these suggestions..
501,1549057589.6091,Bethany,good luck!
501,1549057595.6093,Darlene,"Boss just came in and said team drinks, so I'm gone, thank you again!"

```
self.my_data, self.my_labels = data, labels

```
self.my_data, self.my_labels = (data, labels)

or this:

```
my_stuff = (data, labels)
self.my_data, self.my_labels = my_stuff)

515,1549139953.6766,Bea,"Lengthy question to follow...; Hey there, I am fairly new to Python, having only written little self contained scripts, importing standard packages. I am trying to create a script that is a little more complex, but I am running into an issue with circular import errors.

My file structure looks like this:
```start.py
content/
    crud.py
    content_object.py
    create.py
    update.py
    delete.py
menu/
    main_menu.py
```
The `start.py` file imports `maim_menu.MainMenu` class. As the name implies, the MainMenu class creates a menu with options like _Create Content_, _Update Content_, _Delete Content_ which load the `content/crud.py` which handles loading the appropriate file; ie `content/create.py`. In the create file there is an option to `Cancel` from which I try to load the `MainMenu` again. However, the _import_ gives me a circular import error. I understand why it happens, I am just unclear on how to _reuse_ previously imported classes. I have found quite a bit of suggestions online, but they are all fairly opaque and they all seem to have sentences like ""Well, you could do this, but..."""
515,1549141257.6794,Sasha,"Sorry for the crickets, but as you note it's not a trivial problem. My best suggestion would be if there's some way you could pass in a reference to the `MainMenu` into the `Cancel` function, so it doesn't have to know that it's returning to a `MainMenu` specifically, but just returning to whatever menu object it was originally called from."
515,1549141450.6801,Bea,"Hmm...  Yeah, I'll give that a try. Thanks, <@Sasha>"
516,1549141560.6802,Caridad,"Wondering if anyone can comment on this code snippet. Is there a better way to do what im doing here; essentially when this object is created, i want to validate that the file , passed in as a parameter actually exists; also the use of `self._file_path` as a private attribute, is it common convention to work with private attributes and the `@property` decorator in this way"
516,1549141863.6829,Bernita,if it works it works. what is the question?
516,1549141913.6836,Caridad,"just wondering if there is a better way of doing this, maybe something not as verbose, im guessing maybe not; also is it possible to not have the private attribute at all?"
516,1549142802.686,Marth,I do IT support and I'm trying to help some GIS folks I support (I might even get to do/use some ArcPy).  Does anyone have any suggestions for learning some GIS basics?

Otherwise, I'll do what I usually do and just dive head first and hope for the best :slightly_smiling_face:"
517,1549144881.6921,Bethany,it's easy to do in Python - there's a relatively low recursion default limit. If you can change that to iterative it's usually preferred. if the algorithm is amenable to memoization you  can decorate with @functools.lru_cache but idk if that would help

519,1549157331.7018,Sasha,"Yeah, the `i` there is a two-element tuple as output by `zip`, so you're string-joining the pairs, but not joining all of the items together."

there is one file ``` constants ``` in my project folder.

Now when i do relative import in some other file say file 2 ``` from constants import constants(object in constants file) ```
then python throws error ``` ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package ```.

But if i do relative import as like this ``` from constants import constants as keshav ``` then all works fine.
please help what's wrong going on."
524,1549203563.7218,Hiroko,"btw, `from constants import constants(object in constants file) ` is not valid; so if you have something inside `constants`, like a class or function, you can do `from constants import SomeClass, some_function`; also, you can use `.constants` to denote relative import; note the period"
524,1549203688.7238,Carissa,"but Constants is a class in Constants file; sorii i don't mention period ```.constants``` , but i was using it"
524,1549203890.7253,Hiroko,"so, when you do `import constants`, that means everything inside `constants` is available in that namespace; so, `constants.Constant` is usable inside the file you’re importing to; but if you want to use just the class, you’d do `from .constants import Constant`, which would say “Hey, go to this file in this same package and get me the class named Constant”; then you;d use it like `c = Constant(...)`"

529,1549283194.7848,Carrie,where do I write the dir(sir)?; *str; to run it on Xcode?
529,1549283358.7854,Malika,in any python interpretor; example Jupyter or ipython; or even in terminal; console; just install python
529,1549283420.7864,Carrie,python is installed
529,1549283427.7866,Malika,then workon python environment
529,1549283436.7868,Carrie,I can write on terminal qspectrumanalyzer and runs; I am editing qspectrumanalyzer if you know it to add some functionality; on terminal if I writer; dir(thread) it shows error
529,1549283509.7877,Malika,open your normal terminal and just type `python` and enter
529,1549283554.788,Carrie,did it; then?
529,1549283557.7884,Malika,if python is installed then upon doing this the python interpretor will open
529,1549283563.7886,Carrie,it opened
529,1549283569.7888,Malika,there type dir(str)

529,1549284154.7967,Waldo,Ok sure you have 10 items in your list but lists can grow so if you had 999 items the above would work just the same as if you had 1 item in the list
530,1549284735.7972,Hiroko,"besides when you do that slice, you’re telling it to go from the 0-th index to 999"

529,1549285001.799,Waldo,Has anyone here had the joys of using Magento APIs (version 2.1+) and automating reporting with python?
529,1549285123.7997,Hiroko,the php ecommerce system?
530,1549285255.7999,Waldo,Yup
529,1549285395.8001,Carrie,it shows error.; wtf is going on...; :confused:
531,1549286034.8009,Hiroko,what kind of reporting are you looking for?
529,1549286047.8013,Hiroko,and why python?  isn’t there already something inside magento or php for this?
531,1549286351.8017,Waldo,"There is some reporting within Magento, absolutely"
529,1549286413.803,Waldo,"Issue is we want to pull reports from different tables (which have pretty decent API endpoints themselves) to combine order information, refunds, invoices and any copoun codes used. There is no real single API endpoint that combines all that information"
529,1549286444.8034,Hiroko,gotcha.  and you want to use python with this?
531,1549286455.8037,Hiroko,what output format?
531,1549286465.804,Waldo,"Ideally as the scripts are then being run via cronjobs; Effectively it takes the data, converts to JSON, does a load of logic across the report to create dictionaries with all relevant information and then converts those to a dataframe for further analysis &amp; formatting. The end output is then an excel workbook with multiple tabs"
529,1549286596.8066,Hiroko,"ok, I’ve done something similar, but had to use a async task job to do that, because report generation took about 5 minutes total with about 4:50 of that building the excel file"
529,1549286643.808,Waldo,I do get crashes if the date range is too long and that is where threading may have to come in to play to split the data range i.e. if over 3 months split in to one month per request and thread the requests
531,1549286687.8083,Hiroko,really?  :disappointed:  I didn’t have to worry about that
529,1549286716.8088,Hiroko,"anyway, the simplest way you could do it is with a cronjob and python script"
531,1549286742.8094,Hiroko,"the report would execute over a specific interval, say once a day at midnight"
531,1549286816.8109,Waldo,"So I have already got multiple reports running at their required time intervals however we are re-working how we recognise revenue therefore instead of looking at order tabel look at invoice table and credit table and get the Net for a given day; To add more confusion in the mix the timestamps on the database are UTC, the server is set to UTC and we report on PST timezone (-8 hours)"
531,1549286892.812,Hiroko,oh boy; how much python experience do you have?
531,1549287103.8126,Waldo,mmm; Couple of years on and off of tinkering and automating tasks; Pretty solid understanding of core concepts
531,1549287219.8139,Hiroko,"alright.  that makes things a little easier; so, xslxwriter is a great package for writing excel files"
531,1549287244.8148,Waldo,oh sorry - my question was not so much about the how; more about some of the why with report discrepancies; Pandas can handle the excel writing easily with the ExcelWriter; Everything is 'working' however when I do a daily breakdown for Jan there is one day that is showing c. 35% less revenue than what Magento is reporting; I guess this is more focusing on nuances of Magento data structure; Bu the above context also explains the moving parts
531,1549287471.8178,Hiroko,makes sense; but the why can be linked tightly with the how
531,1549287562.8184,Waldo,"Yeah, appreciate that; I think since sounding it out a little it is a case of printing out line by line what the script is doing and debugging where possible; My assumption was there may have been an error with the data it was using to run the analysis (i.e. missing invoices) but they have all been confirmed to be correct; so line by line it is and if there is anything more specific I will shout again!"
531,1549287667.8205,Hiroko,good luck :slightly_smiling_face:
531,1549287678.8208,Waldo,haha thanks and appreciate the sound board <@Hiroko>
531,1549287713.821,Hiroko,:rubberduck: :smile:
531,1549287733.8213,Waldo,indeed! We all need a rubber duck from time to time; Well most of the time for me as working in silo on most of this stuff!!
531,1549287762.8222,Hiroko,do you have others in house to bounce ideas off of?
531,1549287783.8229,Waldo,nope - startup business right now
531,1549287784.823,Hiroko,"I used to work as the sole dev in a silo on a django project, and it did feel isolating at times, which is why I had to expand online connections"
531,1549287813.8237,Waldo,My job is actually operations and a lot of this is automating management reporting so we can focus on decisions not collating data
531,1549287826.8242,Hiroko,makes sense
531,1549287836.8248,Waldo,hence why I find this group to be an amazing shoulder to cry on!
531,1549287854.8253,Hiroko,would integrating something like new relic or datadog be helpful?
531,1549287884.8264,Vanita,"my teammate is 99% JS which is heart breaking... ""But it can do that.. no! It can't, not easily"" (recent convo around `return ...` before finishing a function in flask, it just can't happen"
531,1549287970.8276,Waldo,I had the joys of working with a front end guy at a hackathon that clearly was not comfortable with nth child selection in CSS so ended up pretty much writing the whole view logic in the function
531,1549288058.828,Hiroko,bet you’re glad you won’t have to worry about maintaining that :smile:
531,1549288140.8286,Waldo,I learnt quickly at hackathons no one cares as long as it lasts the demo
532,1549288562.829,Hiroko,which… kinda explains react’s initial SSR :smile:
531,1549288603.8298,Hiroko,"it was originally spawned from a FB hackathon, and stayed pretty much an operational hack throughout all of v15.  16 brought alot of perf improvements in that regard"
531,1549289081.8315,Conrad,"&gt;I used to work as the sole dev in a silo on a django project, and it did feel isolating at times, which is why I had to expand online connections
I'm the sole dev right now on a django-backed web product, and it feels isolating, so that's why I've entered this group"
531,1549289088.8318,Waldo,Also found my issue - dummy here was not multiplying item cost by qty ordered as assumed each item was a separate entry in an item list for the invoice!
531,1549289121.8329,Conrad,"we have hired a dev and he joins month-end, but I wasn't too keen on that guy. the guy we wanted refused the offer at the last stage"
531,1549289140.8335,Waldo,Let's hope he is not on this group!
531,1549289149.8339,Hiroko,"<@Conrad> oh boy.  fun times.  that’s why I came here, because everyone else in the shop was C#/Sitecore/angular, and I was python/django/react; so not too much overlap"
531,1549289187.835,Conrad,"hahaha well he might be, and it might hurt to read this, but he knows his capability is not the best it could be, which is what I promised to him would increase a lot if he works here in the interview"
531,1549289192.8352,Hiroko,"<@Waldo> good job, not bad for early Monday :smile:; well, late for you :slightly_smiling_face:  I’m just starting the day"
531,1549289215.8361,Vanita,I'm just happy to have folks in EU time that are into Python
531,1549289217.8363,Conrad,<@Hiroko> C# is nice. I started out in C# in college and it was my first irc channel
531,1549289233.8367,Hiroko,"agreed, I started out in java, so lots of similarities; but not too much when you’re quite literally 8 years out of date and having to pay for extended support; which was the case with the other team’s sitecore platform"
531,1549289275.8378,Vanita,there’s no Ireland flag? doh :disappointed:; :flag-ie:; ah
531,1549289285.8385,Waldo,there it is
531,1549289313.839,Conrad,8 years
531,1549289316.8393,Vanita,i spent a fair chunk of my twenties hanging out with a guy called Dave Edwards strangely
531,1549289317.8395,Conrad,ouch
531,1549289339.8397,Waldo,Was he overly dependent on beer in his 20s?
531,1549289347.8401,Vanita,"half head Dave. He shaved one side of his head and alternated long sleeve on one side, short on the other and long trousers on one side, shorts on the other; rode a unicycle everywhere"
531,1549289362.8407,Waldo,haha ok definitely not me!!; Got a full head of hair / 100% bald now?
531,1549289387.8416,Hiroko,"yeah.  so, if you’re not aware, sitecore is a proprietary cms in c#, costs about 25k or so per seat for the license.  each dev needs a license.  then you need the license for MSSQL, because the free version won’t work well.; so, that company was three major and however many minor versions out of date when I left, and about four upgrade projects failed miserably; you know things are interesting when you have highly competent contractors and consultants scratching their heads at how the project is set up"
531,1549289788.8434,Conrad,nicely escaped

533,1549300014.8521,Nenita,None
533,1549300044.8529,Hiroko,"if there’s a noticeable lag between the read and iter, then that’s the data load time; an alternative could be for you to pickle the data, or use <https://www.h5py.org/>"

533,1549300288.8559,Hiroko,"basically, the problem is you’re taking a while to load the data; well, more acurately; loading the data, and you’re going through 2.7 million lines; line by line by line"
533,1549300413.8589,Marth,"dd82 will likely be able to provide better help, but some other (non-python) things to maybe check:
1. I THINK read_csv loads the data into memory.  Maybe check your memory...see if it's paging some of it?
2. Is the source on a spinning drive?
3. Is the paging file on a spinning drive?
4. In the system monitor showing high memory usage?

Of course, if I'm wrong and read_csv doesn't load the data into memory, you can pretty much ignore everything I just said :slightly_smiling_face:"

can anyone tell me how to make current working directory as a package, because python doesn't treat current working directory as package.

538,1549309178.8818,Bethany,<@Nenita> did you profile `data.iterrows():` separately from `read_csv`. Iter rows is notoriously slow
538,1549309200.882,Nenita,yes; Exact code
538,1549309250.8825,Bethany,where is `data` coming from?; like <@Hiroko> suggested you could use something like HDF. It allows for random access IO so you can iterate in parallel; combined with `dask.DataFrame` its also convenient
538,1549309572.8846,Waldo,I would try as <@Bethany> suggests and stick the csv in to a Pandas DataFrame and see if that works any better
538,1549309590.8849,Bethany,that's what he's doing right now; but it can be made parallel if need be using dask
538,1549309937.8868,Nenita,"<@Bethany> oops, forgot to put that back lol I had adjusted it originally to try the link <@Hiroko> posted earlier.; what method is used to iter through HDF5? iterrows, items?"
539,1549310662.8889,Sparkle,<@Sha> the regular expression for that is `to_char\((.*?)\)`  - note the escaping of the outer parens  to indicate literal parens - and then inner parens (not escaped) to create a capture group in the regular expression  - if you want it to contain `cnpj` you can check for that after the fact

560,1549404091.0301,Kristine,"Yeah, as long as the ODT template can have images in it (which from the time I’ve spent in Open/Libre Office I’m sure it can) then that’s a great solution."
560,1549404096.0304,Ashley,<@Javier> they mean a screenshot of all the files and folders inside `Z:/useful_functions/`
560,1549404121.032,Carmen,"Is the image dynamic, or will it be static?"
560,1549404124.0323,Ashley,I think they mean*
560,1549404126.0324,Javier,"<@Ashley> I do it has `name = ""useful_functions""` in it"
560,1549404126.0325,Hiroko,"if you dont have an `__init__.py`, that directory is not a package; directory/folder != package"
560,1549404161.0336,Javier,I do have __init__.py
560,1549404167.0338,Kristine,"Static image, it’s going to be a couple of things like company logos."
560,1549404177.034,Carmen,Then you should be perfectly fine.

560,1549404220.0359,Javier,I'm just trying to import in a python terminal in vs code.
560,1549404231.0361,Ashley,"ah ok; yeah, so basically, the python interpreter you're running has no idea where that package is"
560,1549404268.0373,Javier,I tried telling it that it was in Z
560,1549404280.0376,Ashley,"IIRC, it looks in the site-packages folder associated with that python binary, or in the current working directory"
560,1549404302.038,Javier,"Yeah, do I need to add to sys.path before I run?"
560,1549404351.0393,Ashley,"I would just wrap it all in another folder, and then put a setup.py in the parent folder so you can treat it like an installable repo"
560,1549404361.0396,Tabetha,"You can edit sys.path, but it would be better to give that hint as you run the application using the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. Or ever better, install it locally"
560,1549404390.0403,Ashley,"you can look up a super simple setuptools setup.py example to copy and paste, and then just run `python setup.py develop` from that directory"
560,1549404441.0415,Javier,I don't know what any of that is
560,1549404459.0418,Ashley,"that'l tell that python executable where to look for the files (`python setup.py install` will build a copy to put into your site-packages folder, so it won't see the changes you make. `develop` just points to the original files so it sees the changes you make); <@Javier> no worries; so to recap real quick; you can have multiple python executables on a single machine. this is what makes virtual environments feasible; every python executable has a location hard-coded into it that points to a specific `site-packages` folder; the `site-packages` folder is where a python executable will look to find all the packages that it has ""installed""; this is what ""installing a package"" means in the context of python; `setuptools` is a tool package meant to make developing installable python packages easier/consistent; it does this through a `setup.py` file, which, typically, shouldn't be inside your python package itself. Instead, it usually sits in the folder just above it"
560,1549404740.0466,Javier,Okay I think I understand now
560,1549404744.0468,Ashley,"for example, here's the repo for pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/>; you can see the `setup.py` file in the root, but the package code itself is actually in a deeper folder"
560,1549404809.0485,Javier,My phone is dying I'll have to look at that later.
560,1549404813.0487,Ashley,"typically, you'd see the first `__init__.py` somewhere like `&lt;root folder&gt;/src/__init__.py`; no worries"
560,1549404840.0494,Javier,<@Ashley> :taco: 
560,1549404854.0497,Ashley,"check out setuptools and setup.py tutorials, and they will walk you through. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to get you up and running"
560,1549404866.05,Javier,I will do that; I've been struggling with absolute paths for a while. It's so simple and I have absolutely no idea why it isn't working
560,1549404913.0515,Ashley,"yeah, you have the right idea; it's just kinda annoying to tell python where to look; unfortunately, you can't tell it where to look directly. instead you have to put files where it's already looking (i.e. `site-packages/`) that point at your code, and setuptools can take care of that for you"

570,1549450496.0881,Karoline,"here works; So I think the issue is you need one or more of the `[a-zA-Z]` so you should change your regex to `\b[a-zA-Z]+\b` and I think it will work for you; because what you are searching for is a single letter that is at the beginning and end of a word; Or - I guess the better thing to do is ask what you want to see returned from that, because I suppose there are other ways to interpret what you wanted to match.; But my change would match both `Hi` and `there`."

570,1549452055.1059,Micki,Its just I give command to preprovision device which starts the state machine; its more about state machine and thread knowledge; in python; if some has already worked on it might know; and its a working code in one repo; I am moving to another repo

We cannot help you as you have not provided a small code sample that shows the issue ; And the issue is not to do with state machines, that's just something composed of something else.; You may find the issue you are looking for by creating the smallest possible sample that reproduces the problem ; But you can't just dump a lot of code and say ""it's not working"" and expect anyone to be able to help you, sorry :confused:"
571,1549454550.112,Micki,I gave all the code which was relavent

```; For a while I thought I was hitting this issue: <https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues/857>
but since in the docker environment there is a hang and not an exception, it doesn’t feel like the exact same thing….
Which is why I wanted to debug it when it occurs :slightly_smiling_face:"
572,1549459261.1664,Hiroko,"hmm; so, do you know how to bring in an external lib into a python docker project?"
572,1549459363.1677,Gregg,I can do that since it is my own project and I can change the docker image as needed
572,1549459377.168,Hiroko,"so, you can clone kombu and celery locally; add the local repo path to your docker web container’s site packages in docker-compose volumes; so when you open that lib up in an IDE/editor, you can put a pdb breakpoint in celery or kombu; and the code will hit that breakpoint; so you dont have to dig in from a breakpoint in your own application code, i’ll let you start inside the lib code"
572,1549459537.1708,Gregg,"that’s totally doable… but the real problem is that I cannot then attach to the pdb console; nevertheless… by explaining it here and with this conversation, I think I found something useful here <https://stackoverflow.com/a/40449862/227103>"
572,1549459576.172,Karoline,if you `docker-compose run` the container you can attach
572,1549459594.1725,Gregg,Which is to set some options on the docker-compose.yaml file so I can do `docker-compose attach web-container-id`
572,1549459603.1729,Hiroko,`docker-compose run --rm --service-ports &lt;container-name&gt;`
572,1549459606.173,Karoline,you shouldn't need to do that
572,1549459619.1735,Hiroko,the `--service-ports` is the important flag
572,1549459619.1736,Gregg,"Ah, ok that’s also interesting; Ok I am going to try that right now !"
572,1549459716.1746,Hiroko,"remember, `docker-compose up` won’t let you do this.  there’s a ticket for that which was closed; <https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/4677>"
572,1549459770.176,Gregg,":parrot: I managed to hit a breakpoint and get a console!
Thanks <@Hiroko>, you have enabled me to dig further! :smile:"
572,1549459773.1761,Karoline,"`--service-ports` shouldn't be necesary, right?; Actually - it's definitely not necessary.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
572,1549459869.1773,Gregg,"No, it is necessary. Without it, the exposed ports are not open; But since I enter through a nginx, it does work though; (nginx being another service of my docker-compose)"
572,1549459930.1795,Karoline,Ah I didn't realize there was a need to access the container in question via some ports as well.
572,1549460008.1805,Gregg,"Well, it was not strictly necessary, but since it is a flask application and I can reproduce my problem with some particular request… I did need that; Thanks for the input everyone !; no pun intended; Thanks a lot"
572,1549460231.1815,Karoline,lol
572,1549460342.1819,Hiroko,"its not required if you’re running tests with pytest; so you can do `docker-compose run --rm tests`  but you also need to pass in the flags `-n 0 -s` to have it run single process; otherwise, youll get lots of BadQuit exceptions in your tests with the inclusiion of `import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`"
572,1549461221.1838,Gregg,Yes I’ve had those kind of problems

572,1549465611.1878,Gregg,"<@Hiroko> <@Karoline> I managed to find the source of my endless loop with celery… it was the rpc results backend that fails to connect due to a broken pipe and the fact that the results are retried without a retry policy. That is, they are retried in a infinite loop.
I have no need for the result backend at the moment so I am removing this but I will reconsider if I need that later (or even reconsider a different broker like redis).
Thanks again for the discussion, it let me find this bug that has been annoying me for a while"
574,1549465899.1881,Hiroko,nice!
572,1549465915.1885,Hiroko,"and FYI, using rabbit as a result backend is a very bad idea, would suggest using redis if you need that; Its easy to do when you’re in local dev, but rabbit is for messages and queuing, not storing"
575,1549471028.1901,Carmen,"Just for further information, when you use Rabbit as a results backend, you only get to access that result once. Since Rabbit is a messaging system, once you've read that message it tosses it.; Which can be somewhat okay in most cases, but if you use anything that needs multiple reads of a result (like chaining a group of tasks), you're going to have your tasks hanging permanently."
576,1549474435.1922,Jettie,"&gt; you only get to access that result once
can't you, like, not ack the message? :troll:"

577,1549479110.2075,Ashley,"<@Javier> you can format it, you just need to use `datetime.datetime`; instead of `time`"
577,1549479134.2083,Javier,Why use that here when time.strftime works everywhere else?
577,1549479187.2086,Ashley,"because datetime works everywhere else, too?; although; the error you got, i think, is because you're using `time`, and not `time.time`; hmmm nevermind"
577,1549479230.2101,Javier,I used time literally right above it
577,1549479230.2102,Ashley,I just looked up the namespace

577,1549479388.2123,Javier,Yeah
577,1549479392.2126,Ashley,`os.path` is a module

586,1549514976.2452,Carmen,"<@Janella> You'll get more answers from a broader range of experiences if you ask this in <#C64GEEM7U|job_advice>.; My opinion is that ultimately, you have to learn by doing. Running through tutorials isn't a bad thing at all, but in my experience every developer I've ever met or seen has learned more from working on projects and figuring things out while doing so than they ever got from an educational course or from tutorials.; Tutorials and courses are good for getting you acquainted with something, be it a language, a library, or a methodology. But once you've gone through one or possibly two of those, you should have the bare minimum necessary to jump into a project of some kind. Pick a need you have and try building a piece of software to scratch that itch. The first half-dozen will suck, and that's fine. The only way to learn what works and what doesn't is by doing, and that absolutely implies that you're going to do things that don't work in the process."

600,1549556086.2785,Gemma,"<@Ted> , `Child` is a subclass of `Parent` whose implicit super class is `object`. Instead, make `Parent`'s super class `Classifier`."
600,1549556360.28,Ted,"thanks for this, Im not too sure I get what you mean. are you suggesting to have something like `class Parent(Classifier):`?"
600,1549556407.2803,Gemma,"yes, but now I'm confused because you say
`issubclass(Child, Classifier)` is `True`"
600,1549556627.2806,Ted,"What i am trying to work out is how to get `Child` to be a inherited from the `Parent`. This is so we get `issubclass(Child, Parent )`. This i think is easy enough. But to spice things up I wanted to have an abc called `Classifier` that views the children of parent as a subclass of itself.; I think the main issue I am having is the `@abc.abstractproperty` call. It will only see foo if it is defined outside the __init__"
600,1549557000.281,Carmen,"It's important to note that if you subclass from a subclass, the final class you declared is still going to detect as a subclass of the original class. i.e. `issubclass` checks the entire ancestry tree to verify if a class is a descendant subclass, not just the immediate parent class."
600,1549557038.2814,Gemma,i was trying to verify this <@Carmen>!; thank you

I have a python scripts with functions.
I want to run this python script in jenkins pipeline- Not as a whole script. run this function under step build, run that function under step install, etc... Is it possible? If so, how?

someone told me I can use python fabric for that, cause it can run specific functions.. but fabric as it seems is a different syntax than python.. so I would probably need to convert my script to fabric first, right? is there a simpler way?"

Everything you do is either a library call, or a decorator.; Your actual code to run things is straight up Python.; Fabric is purely focused on declaring which things are tasks and what target servers you want to run them against.; Are you wondering how you could use the Fabric task declaration system, or how you can parse parameters from the commandline?"

635,1549736695.4429,Deangelo,"Hello, complete newbie here.
What's the best way to build a python microservice with a REST api, without the overhead of a heavy web framework?"
635,1549737127.4436,Marita,<@Deangelo> Flask is very popular for microservices.
635,1549737591.4439,Deangelo,Thanks <@Marita>; would you say Falcon is in par with Flask? <https://fgimian.github.io/blog/2018/05/17/choosing-a-fast-python-api-framework/>
635,1549737679.4457,Marita,"@Simo Never used Falcon. So I’m not sure. Flask is very popular, so you’ll probably have more tutorials available for it."
635,1549737832.4477,Deangelo,"cool, I might perhaps also use a swagger code generator to build the api interface dynamically based on api specs"
635,1549737837.4479,Carmen,Flask literally took me a single Python script and an HTML template to build a microservice. It's hard to get much simpler and faster than that.
635,1549737906.449,Deangelo,"good to know. by the way, I'm not looking to serve html, just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers; which is why I don't need all the features of a web framework"
635,1549738085.4499,Carmen,"Then yeah, you could potentially implement the entire thing in a single Python file."
636,1549738638.4506,Deangelo,thank you
635,1549739422.4524,Hiroko,"<@Deangelo> if you're interested in having async, you can make your own pretty easily with aiohttp or quart ; Quart is basically flask on asyncio "
635,1549739929.4539,Deangelo,thanks <@Hiroko> I'm currently looking at integrating a swagger generator and either flask or falcon using the generated client to implement the api endpoints
635,1549739978.4543,Hiroko,"reason I pointed out async is you described your desires as

&gt;just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers; which, to me, means lots of blocking actions; if you’re able to do them concurrently, means better workload overall and more efficiency"
635,1549740128.4563,Deangelo,that's a good point. I'm surprised python can do async. does it implement an event loop to achieve this?
635,1549740142.4565,Hiroko,"yes; but unlike node, python has multithreading and multiprocessing; so you can kick off the compute intensive futures to threads and processes to execute; whereas with node, you’re all single threaded in the event loop, which means if you’re doing compute with IO returns, that’s clogging up the event loop"
635,1549740396.4596,Jonas,"Threading can be a bit tricky though, as technically python itself is single threaded "
635,1549740428.4612,Hiroko,correct.  but you can also set it up so one asyncio event loop exists per thread; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52298922/how-do-i-set-the-asyncio-event-loop-for-a-thread-in-python/52301233#52301233>
635,1549740433.4617,Jonas,"So you need to be somewhat careful about what you offload to a thread, if it calls a C function that doesn't release the GIL then bad things can happen"
635,1549740456.4623,Hiroko,":point_up:; as always, there’s no silver bullet.  there’s always caveats and edge cases"
635,1549740600.4643,Deangelo,"so this looks like something you can easily introduce to an existing flask application, or does it have to be setup when creating the project?"
635,1549740660.4657,Hiroko,check out <https://github.com/pgjones/quart>
635,1549740694.4661,Deangelo,I was just looking there
635,1549740707.4667,Jonas,"it's not usually something you can just plug into an existing app; you'd need to make big changes to how it works. For example, you can't do `requests.get()` in the service; if you're interacting with a database, that needs to be changed; it's well worth it though. 90+% of the time spent in a flask app is just networking stuff: redis, the database, receiving/reading the response"
635,1549740819.4686,Deangelo,&gt; It should be possible to migrate to Quart from Flask by a find and replace of flask to quart and then adding async and await keywords. See the docs for full details.
635,1549740842.4691,Hiroko,"FWIW, Quart is the Flask API ported to use asyncio and aiohttp"

635,1549741029.4716,Jonas,^
637,1549741036.4719,Deangelo,is there a project boilerplate with quart and a hello world endpoint?
635,1549741049.4724,Jonas,"the globals always smelled weird to me. I get that it looks nice in a small, 1 file app; but ergh, it's really too magical; That flask migration page is really way to short; for a hello-world ""read a response, output a template"" app sure, but for any flask app that does _anything_, it will need more work than is described there"

635,1549741727.4756,Hiroko,"there was an interesting breakdown about sanic on reddit abut 8 months or so ago; basically, the premise was that its fail fast tendency and speed of breaking changes increased the instability of apps built on it"

642,1549753679.5064,Rubi,thanks <@Carmen>! This SO article seem to be describing solution to a more generic case of building a library with dependencies. In my case I need to create a wheel package in a way that when it's installed on a system with `pip install` it does not try to download anything from the internet
642,1549753680.5066,Hiroko,"No worries!; Ive managed to avoid xpath, which is probably both good and bad"
642,1549753938.5078,Carmen,"So it's describing the general case, but if you read the attached article, it goes into the reasonings behind it. Ultimately, what you're wanting to do is package everything up so it can be installed without an internet connection. The method that answer describes will do that for you.; You're not going to get a single wheel that has all of the dependencies + your library, but you will get a combined folder that you can transfer over and point pip at to do the install in an offline fashion."
642,1549754100.5082,Rubi,"Oh, sorry, should have opened the article! Thanks!; to me the biggest issue is that wheels are just an archive, and there is no way to add pre-install logic, because `pip install &lt;library.whl&gt;` simply extracts all contents of an archive. Logic for eggs is different though, when pip installs eggs, it also calls `setup.py install`."

Let’s say I have a string that looks like this:

```""{'apple': 1, 'orange': 2}""```

How can I determine if this is a valid json object? json.loads() doesn’t work because the string uses single quotes instead of double. Replacing all single quotes with doubles quotes seems risky in the off chance a single quote is escaped, like this:

```""{'sentence':'let\'s solve the issue'}""```
Replace all single quotes with double quotes makes the sentence: let”s solve the issue, which is not correct.

I'm trying to decide between using `django-registration`: <https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/quickstart.html> and using the Sign Up with Confirmation e-mail method in this article: <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2017/02/18/how-to-create-user-sign-up-view.html>? I'm leaning towards the latter because it is simpler and will be easier to extend for my use case since I'm using a custom model based on `AbstractBaseUser` and `django-registration` seems like it will give me a harder time to implement for my use case.

666,1549906320.0955,Philip,"Hi all, I'm currently testing out an api on postman wherein the json body is pass to `xdata` via form-data. Now I usually handle `application/json` so I have no idea how to replicate this. Upon clicking code in postman for python, this is what it tells me to do.

```
import requests

url = ""<http://v2.xend.com.ph/rates/calculate>""

payload = ""------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gWContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\""xdata\""{\""destination\"": 1, \""package_type\"": \""UX\"", \""pickup\"": 1}------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--""
headers = {
    'content-type': ""multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW"",
    'cache-control': ""no-cache"",
    'Postman-Token': ""28bc5105-5d63-4fd1-8f4f-e6add99c02b5""
    }

response = requests.request(""POST"", url, data=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

What I tried so far:
```
data = {'xdata': args} 
response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(url, params=data)
```

and

```
data = {'xdata': json.dumps(args)}
response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(url, params=data)
```

Both of which fails because the api does not recognize the `params` sent; The json body I'm testing out:
`{""destination"": 1,  ""package_type"": ""OP"",  ""pickup"": 2} `; I know I can simply manipulate the payload from postman's generated code, but I would like to understand how to handle `form-data` in requests in general."

TIL how to send a “multipart/form-data” with requests in python"
666,1549907566.0979,Carmen,Requests is a lovely library.; It's my go-to for HTTP automation. I only branch out when I need something specific like UI interaction.
666,1549907663.0996,Philip,"For the record, what would the best practice for an api payload be? `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`?; I normally expect my requests in a form of json, thus me having no knowledge of `multipart/form-data` up till now."
666,1549907792.1021,Jettie,"application/json out of those two; multipart/* is browser-centric, imo"
666,1549907814.1032,Carmen,"100% depends on the API. If it's intended to be a JSON API, you send `application/json`. If it's something that nominally accepts POSTs from forms, `multipart/form-data`. Normally an actual API will prefer the former.; The latter tends to be for endpoints that accept form posts directly."

667,1549908562.1133,Angele,"Hi, I have a function f1 that takes as input another function f2 and returns an value. f1 is called on a series of inputs (lambda invocation). Is there a way to pass an argument to f2, and an additional return value from f2 back to the root that then modifies the next input to f2 and so on..?; To phrase it another way: Is it possible to process values based on previous frames in Python's MoviePy library? Specifically, the VideoFileClip.fl_image() function?"
667,1549908688.1154,Carmen,"You're describing the `reduce` pattern.; Are you sending the `f1` input into `f2`, or just calling `f2` as part of processing the input for `f1`, and its parameters are completely separate?"

667,1549909308.1206,Carmen,"Do you have a complete list of the inputs you're applying the function to, or is it something that happens inside the MoviePy library code, and thus you can only provide a lambda that they're invoking?"
667,1549909482.1219,Angele,I have a complete list of the inputs (all frames in the video clip) in advance. But based on each frame's processing in f2 (my own user defined function) I want to modify the input to the subsequent call to f2 (which processes the next frame)
667,1549909616.1234,Carmen,"That's good. I'd recommend you write a third function `f3` that takes the function `f2` and your frame list as parameters, then loops through the inputs, applying `f1` and storing the output of `f1` (which should include whatever `f2` is returning) for providing to the next loop.; In rough form:
```def f3(f2, frame_list):
    f2_param = None
    return_list = []
    for frame in frame_list:
        (other_output, f2_param) = f1(f2, frame, f2_param)

667,1549912539.1309,Marth,"<@Nola> If it's not private data, can you share the `head()` of your dataframes (or more if necessary) and what you'd like the end result to be?"

667,1549912930.1332,Carmen,"<@Angele> Can you provide a link to the documentation for whatever `f1` and `f2` are, so I can see their signatures? We're bumping into the limits of what I can help with without more information. I assumed you had more control over the function signatures; since that's not the case, I need more information."
669,1549912937.1333,Marc,None; it works; but maybe there is a more efficient way?
669,1549913264.1359,Clemmie,<@Marc> Yeah - set the nums as keys in a dict and the index as the value. The  avg key lookup is 0(1). For each key (sorted) `try: return my_dict[9-num] except KeyError: pass`; If your keys are sorted you also only need to go up to the key target/2
669,1549913353.1372,Marc,hm ok; i will try
667,1549913392.1383,Angele,"<@Carmen> Sure, here's the documentation for f1: <https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/ref/VideoClip/VideoClip.html?highlight=fl_image#moviepy.video.compositing.CompositeVideoClip.CompositeVideoClip.fl_image>"
669,1549913406.1386,Angele,f2 is a user-defined function so that's not a problem
670,1549914571.1396,Nola,"<@Marth> the end result would be for me to put the ""last_index"" value into the df4.loc[index,""reason_code""] so it aligns with the appropriate index value; ValueError: Incompatible indexer with Series, this is the error im getting but the index will never match from ""last_index"" because its the actual value in the loop thats found.; Does that make sense?; Oh. im sorry after reading it again i see what you did"
670,1549914988.1442,Carmen,"<@Angele> So what you'll want to do is be constructing a function that uses `f2` on the fly in `f3`.
```
def f3(f2, frame_list):
    f2_param = None
    return_list = []
    for frame in frame_list:
        new_f2 = lambda img: f2(img, f2_param)
        (other_output, f2_param) = fl_image(new_f2, frame)
       return_list.append(other_output)
    return return_list

681,1549968730.2022,Philip,"Hi all, sorry for the intrusion. I'm kinda stuck with the usage of hmac in headers. (image from postman headers)

signature is derived as per the pre-request script as follow:
```
let signature = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(`${time.toString()}POST/v2/quotations${body}`, environment['secret']);
```
I think the code below does the trick (haven't tested it yet cuz I lack the header)
```
apikey = '5b8b9ee8167b41958a0bd77f68eaf404'
nonce = 1549605063395 # Copied from postman should be datetime.today().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S%f') but pretty sure I gotta change this
body = {""kindalong"": ""sothiswilldo""}
message = '{}POST/v2/quotations{}'.format(nonce, json.dumps(body))
signature = hmac.new(bytes(apikey , 'latin-1'), msg = bytes(message , 'latin-1'), digestmod = hashlib.sha256).hexdigest().upper()
```

Upon reviewing the postman request, here is what `Authorization` looks like in the header
```
Authorization:""hmac 5b8b9ee8167b41958a0bd77f68eaf404:1549605063395:6090f62eece9bf1254c2c2b837ce85cef0fa2e07e6265cac936c64488fd27f83""
```
Any tips or docs would definitely help :slightly_smiling_face:"
680,1549968866.2032,Philip,"Ok, now that I've taken a good look at it, I think the value `hmac` is simply a string?"

681,1549969025.2059,Philip,Thanks <@Jimmy>! :taco: I thought the `hmac` value on the headers was something special. I'll try doing a request first using the signature generated and constructing the header value for `Authorization` as a string.

690,1549998561.2845,Clemmie,"Yup. nut the last year is handled by the line after the loop. Strictly speaking you could do it without the length check like this (I did it the way I did because I forgot if slicing would throw an index erorr. It doesn’t so this is better)
```
monthly = &lt;yourlist&gt;
yearly = []
while len(monthly) &gt; 0:

Once I get this small page margin issue sorted out, I just have to write a python script to take the incoming data, replace it in the page, convert it to a PDF, and print it."

705,1550060419.4096,Lorinda,hello guys; None; Guys I need help with the above code.
705,1550060465.4106,Ashley,What's your question?
705,1550060473.4109,Lorinda,This is from QSpectrumAnalyzer; and I have connected HackRF; This is the process initiated for the start button to start scanning. There is also encoded the restart process of the hardware (hackrf) and that's what I am trying to implement. I have made all the necessary changes and I now have created the def process_reset(self) to initiate the code hackrf_spiflash -R that does the reset.; However I don't understand the above code block that does the start... in order to mirror the process and do the reset process.
705,1550060669.4146,Ashley,What don't you understand about it?
705,1550060760.4153,Lorinda,"I would like someone to explain line by line what it does... for example what is this: ""-f"", ""{}....; I am pretty beginner and the task is above my level; but it must be done."
705,1550060951.4174,Ashley,"Well, I can't really go line by line, but the bulk of it seems to pretty much just be generating a command to call in the shell/command prompt, and then at the end it does so; It looks like you're printing out towards the end, which should tell you what the exact command is that it's calling"
705,1550061082.4185,Lorinda,thanks for the tip; any idea how i could implement the reset function?; is the above code a good representation of what i must do with reseT?
705,1550061187.4214,Ashley,"I'm unfamiliar with those tools, but probably not. But it should tell you what the main command is, and you can look up the documentation for it where there should be something about resetting it, if that's something it supports"
705,1550061362.4218,Lorinda,yep the command hackrf_spiflash -r; does the reset; but i don't yet know how should i start to implent it on the process_reset()
705,1550061538.4229,Ashley,"Oh, sorry, I misunderstood; Then yeah, you can mimic the code in that function"
705,1550061595.424,Lorinda,"ok where can i find what this does for example: ""-f"", ""{}:{}"".format(int(self.params[""start_freq""] - self.lnb_lo / 1e6),
                                     int(self.params[""stop_freq""] - self.lnb_lo / 1e6)),"
705,1550061770.4262,Ashley,"Well, the `""{}:{}”.format()` stuff is just how string formatting is done in Python (there's a few ways, but this is a common one); In general, Python has to evaluate things in a certain order; You'll notice that that's inside a `cmdline.extend()` call. `cmdline` seems to be just a normal list, and the `extend` method of a list takes another list, and slaps it into the end of that list; So you're ""extending"" `cmdline`; But to know what you're extending it with, Python has to figure out what you're passing to `extend`; And to figure the out, it has to evaluate the things inside of the list one at a time; The first thing is easy. It's just `""-f""`; But the next thing takes a little more, because to figure that out, it has to look at the things you're passing to `format`; It's kinda like PEMDAS; If you ignore the `subprocess` and `QtCore` stuff, you're pretty much only dealing with simple python stuff (it's really just lists, numbers, and strings). It's only the context that seems complicated, but you know what you're working with, so you should be fine"

707,1550066374.4394,Hiroko,"well,if data[‘data’] is `None`, then none of your checks look for that; `if data` checks if `data` is None; `and 'data' in data` checks if the key `data` exists; but `data['data']` can be None"

708,1550067522.4424,Clemmie,"If you haven’t figured this out yet, it is because when doing nested loops in list comprehensions the order of loops goes from the outside in, not the inside out as seems natural.

711,1550075074.4594,Jonas,What is `SSH_Invoices`? A module?
711,1550075101.4602,Nenita,correct. it is the main class name

711,1550075172.4627,Nenita,would that __init__ be in the SSH module or in my main module?; alright one sec
711,1550075195.4637,Jonas,"Ok, so a module in Python is a file. It's all the contents of a file bundled up into an object, a 'module'; Generally you never do `module.something = something_else`; unless you really, really know what you're doing."
711,1550075234.4655,Clemmie,"It would be in `SSH_Invoices`, but at the moment you are not using instances, just `classmethod/static` calls"
711,1550075262.4663,Jonas,"Classes live in modules, and are created by doing `something = SomeClass()`. You can pass things into a class by calling it like a function: `SomeClass(some_variable, something=else)`; You have `__init__` methods on classes, not modules.; And when you do `SomeClass()` the `SomeClass.__init__` is called with it's arguments"

711,1550075416.4703,Jonas,"In general it's not great practice to do what you are doing in `.statements()`; you're setting some variables, then you _expect_ people to call `run_statements()`; which uses a class variable and does the right thing :tm:; you could make `run_statements` accept an argument of statements; then when you call `statements()`, it then calls `self.run_statements([....])`?"
711,1550075478.4729,Nenita,thats what im planning; after i read your previous comment
711,1550075530.4737,Jonas,":+1: avoid passing state around using instance variables.; So, for your `statements()` method, it needs a date; so why not add this as an argument; then do `SSH_invoices.statements(self.page1_sel_date.get())`?"
711,1550075557.4752,Nenita,"yep, thats why i ask the question from the get-go because I was like, 'there is no way i am going to find a good answer as specific as im needing using google'."
711,1550075597.4761,Jonas,"You also need an instance of the class, as <@Mica> pointed out. So try doing `invoices = SSH_Invoices()`; then `invoices.statements()`"
711,1550075613.4766,Nenita,"i plan on doing that. after reading your comment ""You can pass things into a class by calling it like a function: `SomeClass(some_variable, something=else)`"""

711,1550075644.4777,Jonas,"it creates a SSH client which may be expensive to create; so you could do `invoices = SSH_Invoices()` at the top of your module, after your imports; or somewhere else that runs when the app starts."

I have two lists
`foo = [1, 2, 3]`
`bar = [a, b]`

I want to take those two lists and create a list of lists of every way I can given an  element of `bar` to an element of `foo`. The order of the elements in the tuple matter, but the order of the elements in the list do not. The output above should look like:

```

    [(1, b), (2, a)],

&gt; I don’t believe what I’m looking for are `permutations`, `combinations` or `cartisean products`; Its important to note, I need the iterations grouped, which `itertools.product` does *not* do"
715,1550081225.4978,Bethany,oh misread thought you thought it was one of those
713,1550081235.4981,Cammie,No worries. I updated the expected output to be more clear
715,1550081244.4983,Cammie,"If you have any more thoughts, please let me know, as I’m stumped"
713,1550081299.4985,Bethany,"ok i think i understand what you're trying to do, thinking"
715,1550081341.4987,Bethany,"can you not accomplish by `zip(bar, combs(foo, len(bar)`; or rather, permutations of foo"
715,1550081503.4992,Cammie,that last sentence lost me
715,1550081513.4994,Bethany,one sec lemme try some things in code
715,1550081514.4996,Cammie,"i followed the code snippet, can you reiterate yor last sentence for me; kk thank you; Did another one out:

```
foo = [1, 2]
bar = [a, b, c]
```

```
[
    [(1, a), (2, b)],
    [(1, a), (2, c)],
    [(1, b), (2, a)],
    [(1, b), (2, c)],
    [(1, c), (2, a)],
    [(1, c), (2, b)],
]
```; Writing that out reminded me of doing EE homework and truth tables…; i think the number of output is

`len(foo) ^ len(bar)`; I’ve rewritten my problem in english

you have a list of children with names
`foo = [""mike"", ""grehg""]`

and you have some cookies with weight

`bar = [1, 2]`

&gt; What are all the different ways you can dish out the cookies, if a child can only receive at most 1 cookie?"
713,1550082609.5013,Bethany,n_children choose n_cookies; thats the statistical term; well the number of them
715,1550082655.5019,Cammie,love it
713,1550082695.5021,Bethany,thats just combination though
715,1550082695.5023,Bethany,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination>
713,1550082705.5026,Cammie,"I’m with you.; Every solution that codes a combination, does so in one big list.; Actually hold up. I dont’ think this is correct.; Because a child can have up to one cookie"
713,1550082738.5034,Bethany,yeah I dont think your metaphor captures the problem
713,1550082740.5036,Cammie,so they may have none
713,1550082749.5038,Bethany,yes so each children has 2 states
713,1550082750.504,Cammie,"To be honest, the metaphor IS the problem; and what I posted was my attempt to make it easier to understand"
713,1550082780.5044,Bethany,are you doing something with microstates and entropy; or literally cookies
713,1550082804.5048,Cammie,uh literally cookies and children
713,1550082845.5051,Bethany,yes so the problem is : I have N children and M cookies. List all possible ways I can give out the cookies
713,1550082850.5053,Cammie,"Correct.; Where N can be &lt;, =, &gt; M"
713,1550082893.5058,Bethany,if max you can give is 1 though if M &gt; N there's only one way: everybody gets one
713,1550082908.506,Cammie,Yup; The cookies can have different weights.; So it still matters.; i’m trying to only talk about specifically what I think is important and I think that’s biting me in the ass when we discuss this
713,1550082953.5069,Bethany,usually that's the case.
713,1550082973.5072,Cammie,"basically a list of strings, denoting children; list of ints, denoting cookie weights; What are all the ways to give out the cookies, where each child can have at most one cookie; That’s the whole problem; I can code this up in a disgusting way, but I was looking for a vocab word or elegant pythonic way; Does that all make sense?"
713,1550083019.5085,Bethany,and there's duplicates weights right?
713,1550083023.5087,Cammie,there can be; they’re not unique by default
713,1550083032.5091,Bethany,"like [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5 ... ]"
713,1550083034.5093,Cammie,"sure; that’s valid; so is
[1, 2, 3]"
713,1550083067.51,Bethany,this is a bit more interesting
713,1550083075.5102,Cammie,hahaha :heart:; Thank you for bearing with me; i’ve loved this discussion
713,1550083152.5108,Bethany,so really what you're dealing with is n_children. You need to put them into groups (cookie weight). The # of children you can put in each group is the # of cookies with that same weight; within the group it's indistignuishable who gets each cookie
713,1550083328.5112,Cammie,"If possible, can you reword it. If I understand correctly than no, that is not correct at all.; But I’m fearful I didn’t understand"
713,1550083444.5116,Bethany,do you need the number of ways to do this or to enumerate the possibilites?; internet went down; gotta go back to work; you might need some clever programming for this
713,1550084017.5124,Cammie,"I need to actually enumerate; No worries mate, thanks for everything regarldess; <@Bethany> :taco:"
716,1550087484.5132,Carmen,"Possibly by modifying a shared state variable within the lambda (though at that point it's probably worth it to define a second-order function for clarity sake). I don't know the best way to do that, however."
717,1550089454.514,Candra,How is pytest for integration testing
717,1550089463.5144,Tarsha,good
717,1550089485.5149,Candra,Currently stuck on nose + unittest but I'm swapping out nose for pytest and keeping the basic unittest foundation for now; But eventually the unit tests need to be tied together to pass input along and it seems like fixtures and context builders will help
717,1550089980.5159,Tarsha,"yeah the fixtures are pretty good; they can do stuff per test, per session, per module or per class; pytest is definitely worth investing some time into"
717,1550090241.5179,Candra,"Having been working with these unittests, the output diff and code snippet is insanely useful; from pytest that is"
717,1550090273.5185,Jonas,"`parametrize` is the biggest killer for me; most tests are pretty similar. being able to convert a single test into 5 or 6 different ones, but with a single method and `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, is amazing"
717,1550090337.5194,Candra,Yeah that's exactly what I was looking to do; I have a single test which runs the same stuff with different values over and over like 6 times; insanely long winded
718,1550099732.5214,Monica,when is a good time to use a python array? From `import array`
718,1550099899.5218,Sharita,Just stick to a list

718,1550099954.5227,Hiroko,"even so, if you have that much, you might as well bring numpy in and use `ndarray`s"

I've been using <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> to create an interface to manipulate data (standard CRUD stuff) and started looking at Flask to implement something similar using Python but is that even a worthwhile way to go? I'm concerned about expending a lot of effort inefficiently. What would you all suggest?
720,1550117901.5331,Candra,"<@Junior> I think this really depends on how big your application is, what it's actually used for and if you know or are willing to learn python"

721,1550122934.5363,Sasha,"You want to specify the upload URL, not the file.; As your form action."

722,1550127569.545,Valeri,I was wondering how I could keep only my commits on a branch and discard any commit made by others; Tried googling but couldn't find something like that

722,1550127655.5464,Valeri,Oh no!; You misinterpreted I guess; I just want my changes on a branch. A co-worker pushed their changes on my branch; I want to discard them
722,1550127780.5484,Cory,git?
722,1550127782.5485,Valeri,Basically I'm looking for a way to filter out  my commits on the branch and keep them; Yes
722,1550127824.5494,Cory,you could look at `git log` to find the commit(s) you want to revert; then use `git revert`
722,1550128009.5498,Valeri,"No I can't; The problem is the commits are in random order; Depending upon when they were authored; I could have cherry picked the latest commit done by me otherwise; And that would have solved my problem; I think I should ask this on SO, what say?"
722,1550128147.5522,Cory,Hmm I see. Not sure what would be best; I'm new here but I imagine this server is busier during US business hours

728,1550153137.5906,Jonas,things in that SO post like relevant tags or even a reproducible code sample don't help
728,1550153183.5915,Karoline,"I disagree - tags yes - but reproducible code samples are often helpful.  If you'd like to create a TLDR; version that'd be a welcome submission though.  Or even a PySlackers version of the SO with a TLDR at the top or something.; If you'd like to offer up some ideas for an improved document, head over to <#CD60CDU7K|community>"
728,1550153241.593,Jonas,"The problem is that the people who ask the bad questions often struggle to create a sample code. I'm just suggesting that we make a tl;dr on _how to ask a question *on slack*_, not how to create a reproducible code sample from your LOB app that has nested calls arms deep and you have no idea what the issue even is let alone how to extract the code; Once the question is phrased correctly it can often be answered without code. A specific type of problem needs a code sample"
729,1550154203.5936,Ashley,"Look at the general things that function does, understand which variables are what types of objects, determine what is or is not necessary for your new function, and duplicate what that function does but for a different command with different flags"
728,1550154268.5938,Ashley,"The task should actually be pretty easy and straightforward, so don't overthink it :wink: ; <@Jonas> you're probably right in a lot of cases, but phrasing can be pretty difficult especially when your new to programming and/or aren't fluent in English. A lot of times, people are so lost that they don't even know what to ask. In those cases, a code sample can help us to understand what they're trying to ask. I 100% agree though that there should be more than just the code sample (gotta have some description of what they are having a problem with beyond ""I get this error, please help""), and I also think we should encourage them to reduce the code sample as much as possible (helps save us time reading through it and encourages the mindset of reducing the problem to its core components, which can lead to them finding the answer on their own). "
730,1550156807.5998,Hiroko,"<@Chester> didn’t you have a link like this recently?; IIRC you posted an alternative to SO’s how to ask question, but my google-fu is failing"

730,1550157011.6008,Hiroko,"that’s it… I should probably re-do that slash command; <@Jonas>, <@Mica> thoughts on the above?"
730,1550157186.6012,Magaly,you're trying to execute a windows script on a linux machine.
730,1550157210.6017,Jimmy,might be a good first contribution from <@Elaine>:wink:
730,1550157303.6024,Mica,"ye I'm pretty chill with either link, though the second is much nicer to read and has some examples which is cool"
730,1550157453.6031,Greg,Really sorry my internet was down...so wasnt able to reply; I have a python script that fetches data from an API. And I want to run that script inside a docker container
730,1550157635.6047,Karoline,if the api is on the public internet then nothing changes
731,1550160552.6097,Juliane,"Hello guys, i want to create CLI tool for my Linux. Something like IP-Manager. For example: ipy add 123.456.23.1 myVps. How to start? I know how to write program. But how to build it and install as linux package?"
731,1550161440.611,Genaro,<@Juliane> start by finding out if your VPS service has an API. from there read on how to make API calls from python and so on
731,1550161640.6131,Juliane,<@Genaro> But this script is very simple. When i type ipy add (ip) (name) i just save this data to file.txt and later i can connect with server with name not ip. For example:; ipy add 123.123.123 myprojectvps; ssh root@myprojectvps
731,1550161711.6143,Mica,are you asking how to package up the application for distribution?
731,1550161715.6145,Juliane,Yup
731,1550161726.6149,Mica,you could look into deploying on PyPI; is it a private application or are you ok with it being public?; <https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py>; something like this for deployment ^
731,1550161844.6177,Juliane,I m ok. But i want to use it like this: ipy add (ip) (name) not like python3 myscript.py role=add ip=123.123.123 name=myname
731,1550161860.6183,Mica,"oh ok; hmm; ye, so you'd need to look at packaging the app up using setup.py"
731,1550161890.6197,Genaro,assuming your script starts with `#/usr/bin/env python` you can do `chmod +x yourscript`. then you can start it with `./yourscript`
731,1550161905.6202,Mica,the above link should show you how to create packages at least; if you build and install you don't have to have the `./`
731,1550161965.6215,Juliane,"Ok thanks guys <@Genaro>, <@Mica>. You helped me a lot :smile:"
731,1550162023.622,Mica,if you cturn it into a package you can run it like any other CLI tool :parrot_fast:; no worries man
732,1550163829.6265,Gregg,"Hi, does anyone know or have any pointers on having a *one_of* required parameters with Click ?
I mean, something like this:
```
$ python main.py -a
ok 
$ python main.py -b
ok
$ python main.py -a -b
Error: a is mutually exclusive with b
```
which is possible with something like <https://stackoverflow.com/a/37491504/227103>

however, I would like this behavior as well:
```
$ python main.py
Error: You need one of options -a or -b
```"
731,1550163966.6274,Mica,"not sure it's possible to have two flags reliant on each other, one not just have a `is_flag` option instead?; or this: <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/options/#choice-opts>; have one flag where you pass a choice"
731,1550164148.6285,Gregg,"No, it’s not a flag, unfortunately… it’s either `--name NAME` or `--id ID`"
731,1550164255.6287,Mica,"```

Feature Switches

In addition to boolean flags, there are also feature switches. These are implemented by setting multiple options to the same parameter name and defining a flag value. Note that by providing the flag_value parameter, Click will implicitly set is_flag=True.

To set a default flag, assign a value of True to the flag that should be the default.

import sys

@click.command()
@click.option('--upper', 'transformation', flag_value='upper',
              default=True)
@click.option('--lower', 'transformation', flag_value='lower')
def info(transformation):
    click.echo(getattr(sys.platform, transformation)())

And on the command line:

$ info --upper
LINUX
$ info --lower
linux
$ info
LINUX

```; <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/options/#feature-switches>"
731,1550164343.6293,Gregg,"Yeah, I read that, it’s not my use-case since it’s not a flag, I need to pass a name or an id; I think I can adapt `MutexOption` for my case though"
731,1550164381.6301,Mica,"yh i have no idea, sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
731,1550165037.6302,Jonas,"Looks really good, I don't think it's perfect but it is better than the current one"
732,1550165144.6304,Jonas,"Honestly, just a response with something like:
1. Explain _what_ doesn't work
2. Provide as much detail as possible. Leave things that are not directly relevant to the problem you are facing.
3. Post a code sample if possible
4. Explain what you have done to debug this issue so far

I have a list of domains like [<http://alpha.com|alpha.com>, <http://gamma.com|gamma.com>] and I want to do some lookups on each domain and then store them back along with the domain. I think this is a dictionary.. so if I looked up the ip address for each then how do I end up with something like [[<http://alpha.com|alpha.com>, 192.65.255.14], [<http://gamma.com|gamma.com>, 62.197.130.185]] ?
Eventually I want to add mail exchange, namerserver and other records for each domain.."
734,1550173559.6376,Claudine,"well; socket library would do it
```
import socket
domains = ['<http://alpha.com|alpha.com>', '<http://beta.com|beta.com>']

domain_ips = []

for domain in domains:
    output = {}
    output['domain'] = domain
    output['ip'] = socket.gethostbyname(domain)
    domain_ips.append(output)
```"
734,1550173640.6397,Chiquita,i’m happy to throw it all out and use another method that starts from the list.. I just don’t know any yet! :wink:
734,1550173643.6399,Claudine,shit one sec; there ya go
734,1550173672.6405,Chiquita,NP
734,1550173675.6406,Claudine,something like that might work
734,1550173680.6409,Chiquita,hmm
734,1550173682.6411,Claudine,"i always hit enter before finishing my example; in short, if you have a list of URLs you can use the `socket` library to do fun things with them"
734,1550173720.6422,Chiquita,let me see if understand this..
734,1550173730.6426,Claudine,in my example you just loop over each url and call `socket.gethostbyname()` on each one and that function will return the IP address of that URL; and then you just gotta put the domain and the IP together
734,1550173764.6436,Chiquita,you made a new dictionary by iterating through each domain and getting the info.. so if I look at domain_ips it will be all the info.; I think :wink:
734,1550173788.6443,Claudine,"yea oops i forgot to append `output` to `domain_ips` though, just added that"
734,1550173798.6446,Jimmy,There is probably a `dns` module in python; because a hostname could have multiple ip
734,1550173818.6458,Claudine,"yea probably, if you're trying to get MX records and stuff that may be better"
734,1550173829.6462,Chiquita,there is `dns_python` and `pywhois` for other stuff.
734,1550173830.6464,Jimmy,"and if you want MX etc, might be easier to directly start with dns"
734,1550173875.6471,Chiquita,Thanks <@Claudine> <@Jimmy> this makes sense and give me a starting point. TY!

735,1550176972.6571,Claudine,python has a ggplot module :slightly_smiling_face:
735,1550177016.658,Misha,is not; it's int; but don't know how to go about it

735,1550177044.6597,Claudine,"looks like your error says it needs a float, you may just be able to cast it to one"
735,1550177054.6603,Cherish,<@Aleshia> I’d second matplotlib. The learning curve can be tough depending on what type of visualizations you’re making. The examples/docs you’ll find will sometimes be OO version and sometimes not which can be annoying. I’ve used it quite a bit for a couple years now though and the level of control you have over it is awesome. Happy to answer any specific questions you might have
735,1550177058.6604,Claudine,`float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean())`
735,1550177069.6607,Misha,ok; let me give it a try
735,1550177086.6613,Claudine,"yea I made my own wrapper class for matplotlib that automates the setup &amp; colors and stuff; now it's super fast to make charts; just a simple `line(x,y)` or `bar(x,y` and im good to go; i cant say i've done more complicated visualization though; geomapping would be my next trick, one day"
735,1550177215.666,Cherish,I’m doing that right now actually. Which leads to a question of my own: is there a good resource explaining how to get such a module onto PyPi so other people within my company can grab it with pip? I want to make sure for some standardized data visualizations the output is the same regardless of who generates the plots
735,1550177265.6671,Claudine,i see matplotlib referenced the most so I assume it's sort of a defacto standard
735,1550177320.6688,Misha,<@Claudine> I got this error `TypeError: float() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)`

735,1550177477.6695,Claudine,"huh, what's `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` do if you print 'er on out?"
735,1550177563.6705,Misha,I want to calculate *the mean* loan amount in 30-day loans and what is *the standard deviation* of loan amount in 90-day loans? and my answers to the nearest two decimal places.
735,1550177580.6706,Claudine,"i was just looking at seaborn and it looks cool, built on top of matplotlib but with modern aesthetics; sorry poor wording, i meant what is output of printing `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()`; if `float()` thinks `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` has two values"
735,1550177752.6717,Misha,None
735,1550177871.6727,Claudine,"oh yea i see, i may have lead you astray, `round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean(), 2)).iloc[1,1]` maybe; well; no; `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` is that whole table, if you want to round one of the values you have to call `round` on a single value; if `.iloc[1,1]` is intended to grab that one value you'll have to move that inside your `round()` call"
735,1550177981.6769,Misha,Ok
735,1550177995.6773,Claudine,"`round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean().iloc[1,1]), 2)` maybe"
735,1550178002.6776,Misha,Ok
735,1550178033.6783,Cherish,"Oh, also touching on your point about interactive plots <@Aleshia> -- I recently found the `mpld3` library. This is super convenient for sharing visualizations (2D support only) that are still interactive. You can save a `matplotlib` `Figure` to an HTML file using `mpld3.save_html(figure, 'filename.html')`, that others can then open up and interact with the data in the same way they would if they generated the figure themselves:"
735,1550178047.6787,Claudine,"oh by the way it'd probably be best to keep this in one channel, i see we're splitting this across here and <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> . No need to repeat question in multiple channels"

735,1550178983.694,Claudine,"you can search for how to do it in python specifically, but it'd be worth understanding the math behind it"
735,1550179014.6947,Misha,And I joined a group for fun; and picked up a work from them to start solving; I also googled out group to join to learn more; sometimes reading and watching thousands of materials and tuts without hands on is wasting of time; i'm NOT just using this group to solve my lesson but bringing errors that i encountered; Thanks <@Claudine>
735,1550179197.6989,Carlota,"I'm new to Python but not as a developer.  Here, I'm using a library to create an aws `cloudformation` stack.  I want to replace the `eks_cluster_name` for the `ClusterName`.  Apparently, I can't because the data types are different."
735,1550179202.6993,Claudine,"no problem, you could also check out the python module `numpy` which had built in methods for calulcating standard deviation along a specific axis; it's been awhile since i've done any statistical work so I'm not sure myself off the top of my head; `numpy` might be a little unwiedly if you're new to python, it was for me when i started; <@Carlota> do you know the expected data type and what the data type of `eks_cluster_name` are?"
735,1550179351.7014,Misha,"`round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').std().iloc[4,1]), 2)`; I tried this and it worked"
735,1550179470.7046,Carlota,"<@Claudine> the data type for the ```    eks_cluster_name = ImportValue(Sub('${VPCStackName}::EKSClusterName'))
```
the response is a string while it is substituting some of the parameters.  For example, the `${BootstrapArguments}` will be replaced with the parameters passed in the stack."
735,1550179502.7054,Hiroko,"<@Misha> when it comes to homework questions, you’ll get much better responses when you show what you’ve done and ask a question, or describe your current understanding and what you’re unsure about; rather than asking “how do I solve this problem”; it may very well be a language barrier, and you didn’t mean it that way.  but that is a little how you did come across."
735,1550179562.7074,Claudine,<@Carlota> oh i was curious if `print(type(eks_cluster_name)` was `str`
735,1550179562.7075,Hiroko,"and if my interpretation is incorrect, then I apologize"
736,1550179576.7077,Carlota,"oh, let me check"
735,1550179587.7079,Misha,I think 1 is for row  and 4 for  column; yes <@Hiroko>; I'm a working professional (12yrs in media production) and running a small tech startup; And I just think it will be of good benefit to dive into Data Science and I just started 3wks ago; And I pick up a lesson note online by myself to start solving; now i'm encoutering some prob and i need human being to explain something to me...lol:grinning:; Nevertheless thanks for the advise <@Hiroko>
736,1550180079.7165,Carlota,"<@Claudine>
```
print(type(eks_cluster_name))
&lt;class 'troposphere.ImportValue'&gt;
```"
736,1550180430.7209,Marc,newbie question but im iterating over a string and trying to compare a character in the string to its next character; and im using index + 1 but im getting out of range?; None
735,1550180593.7243,Cherish,"<@Marc> that'll happen on your last iteration because `s[ind]` will be grabbing your last value, so `s[ind + 1]` will be out of range. You need to check for that before trying to access `s[ind + 1]`"
735,1550180613.7246,Misha,"My lesson 5

*Late* loans are defined as loans that were paid *more than 3 days* after their due date. Please find the average number of days that these loans were paid beyond their due date for each *week of the year*. This will require you to break all *appilcationDate's* down into the week of the year they were made and then perform a group by.

What is the average number of days that *late* loans applied for in the second week of the year were paid late? Please sumbit your answer rounded to two decimal places.

Now These are my code

# week of year and average number of late days
`Late = mywork[mywork['dateDifference'] &gt; pd.Timedelta('3 days')]`
`Late`

-------- No Issues--------

Then I was at the point of breaking them down into weeks when I encoutered this

`Late['appilcationDate'] = Late['appilcationDate'].dt.week`

C:\Users\VIDIM\Anaconda2\lib\site-packages\ipykernel_launcher.py:1: SettingWithCopyWarning:
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead"
736,1550180654.7257,Marc,<@Cherish> - what do you mean it will be grabbing my last value? You mean it doesn't know it's the end of the index when I enumerate? I have to tell it that there's only x indexes in the string?
735,1550180687.7265,Ashley,"<@Marc> it does, but then you ask it to go one further than the end"
735,1550180730.7274,Cherish,"Yes, if there's X elements in `s`, ie the length of `s`, then on the last iteration of your loop, `ind` will be equal to X, and `ind + 1` will be &gt; X"
737,1550180746.728,Cherish,Which will throw you an out of range error
736,1550180780.7285,Marc,so something like
736,1550180794.7286,Ashley,<@Marc> try this and you'll see how many times it actually goes through the loop. What is inside the loop is irrelevant to how it loops
736,1550180802.7289,Marc,None
736,1550180820.7296,Ashley,more or less
736,1550180826.7301,Marc,yeah it iterates however many times the length of my string is
736,1550180830.7302,Ashley,you can just call `continue` in that case; there's a simpler way though
735,1550180879.7313,Cherish,"Yeah basically that. There's multiple ways you can accomplish it, but what you have captures the premise of what you need to do"
736,1550180904.7316,Marc,okay; It's a bit demoralizing when leetcode problems are tagged as easy and I struggle with them :stuck_out_tongue:
736,1550180953.7329,Ashley,"if it's hard, that just means you get to learn :wink:"
736,1550180960.7332,Marc,<@Ashley> - what would you say the easier way is?
736,1550181084.7341,Ashley,"maybe not easier depending on your perspective, but to get you thinking about lists and iterating, here's a fancy approach"
736,1550181098.7345,Marc,oh god; lol; zip
736,1550181115.7352,Ashley,"zip is actually pretty straightforward; try printing out `s[:-1]` and then `s[1:]` to see what they are individually; then print out the zip of them; (hint: ""zipper"")"
736,1550181253.7365,Marc,understood; None; None
736,1550181724.7377,Ashley,"ahhh yes; that's a little more tricky; but actually easier to solve; <@Marc> I showed you iterable slicing by passing two indexes, e.g. `s[:-1]`. But there's a third possible index you can pass :wink:"
738,1550182458.7401,Marc,"direction, right?; ::-1"
738,1550182495.7405,Ashley,"almost; ""Step""; `[::-1]` means ""step by every negative one indexes"""
738,1550182577.7415,Marc,yeah thats what i meant :slightly_smiling_face:
738,1550182585.7419,Ashley,"doesn't have to be negative, though :wink:"
738,1550182590.7422,Marc,i used that to solve the palindrome question earlier; my code for this leetcode problem so far is a bunch of nested if statemens
738,1550182613.7431,Misha,"`Late['dateDifference'] = Late['dateDifference'].dt.days`
`Late`"
738,1550182618.7433,Marc,and im sure theres a better way than that
738,1550182638.7435,Ashley,it also doesn't have to be `1`
738,1550182677.7436,Misha,None
738,1550182690.7441,Marc,Yeah you can step by by 2's
738,1550182696.7442,Misha,"`Late['dateDifference'] = Late['dateDifference'].dt.days`

`Late`; And I got the above errors"
738,1550182724.7448,Marc,is dateDifference a datetime value or a string?; print(type(dateDifference)); fyi pepi 8 says you shoudnt use snakeCase variable names; should be date_difference; pop*; ugh pep*
738,1550182899.7473,Marth,"good to know <@Marc> re: snakeCase.  Also...in case you didn't know, you should be able to press the up arrow on your keyboard to edit your last post.  EDIT:  SEE!!  :slightly_smiling_face:"
738,1550182928.7482,Marc,snakeCase is usually used for Class names
738,1550182931.7484,Misha,is a string (25 days) but I need to remove the (days) and leave only the value
738,1550182951.7489,Marc,<@Misha> then that is why it's not working because you cant use .dt on strings
738,1550183021.7491,Misha,hmmm; pls how do go about it; newbie in the room pls
738,1550183050.7499,Marc,You're just trying to see if the values are equal?; can you post the relevant block of code?; or youre assigning the days to the dateDifference?
738,1550183312.7508,Misha,ok; None; None; <@Marc> did you get it
738,1550183564.7521,Marc,"Yeah, I see; I'm kind of a newb too, especially when it comes to pandas; but it looks like to you have to_datetime method there; that you can call"
738,1550183641.7534,Misha,None
738,1550183693.7547,Marc,"You dnt have to post screenshots; if you click the _ and click ""Code Snippet""; I mean the +; you can add code snippets; to the chat; pd.to_datetime(late[dateDifference]).dt.day"
738,1550183810.7573,Misha,Ok
738,1550183816.7575,Cherish,"you can also triple backtick for short snippets, ie `x3 follow by 3 more at the end of the snippet"
739,1550183830.758,Misha,Oh..thanks
738,1550183834.7582,Cherish,"looks like ```pd.to_datetime(late[dateDifference]).dt.day
do other stuff
here's another line```"
738,1550183864.7588,Marc,like; yeah; what me and auld said
738,1550183885.7596,Misha,Ok <@Cherish> and <@Marc> :taco:; The dateDifference is given me 1 on all column; I think there is error
739,1550184937.761,Misha,Thanks man... got it sorted

just for reference; sorry for a wall of text :(; There is a related Poetry issue, and people claim it's resolved; <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/issues/321>; yes; &gt; Pip 19.0 was [released](<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#id4>) on 22 January 2019, and I have just successfully Pip-installed a Poetry-managed Python package from a git repository without `setup.py`. So I guess this issue can be closed.

I have the latest `pip` and `setuptools`, and it definitely doesn't work out of the box"

746,1550225394.8005,Waldo,Anyone pretty hot on creating data frames? I have a dictionary of dictionaries I am wanting to create a clean data frame from
746,1550225418.8007,Mica,"yo, what are you planning to do?"
746,1550225423.8009,Waldo,"None; I have the above dynamically created dictonary; Basically looking at sales by day, by sku with each sku having qty sold and revenue"
746,1550225537.8025,Mica,"ok, do you know what you want the DF to look like?"
746,1550225537.8026,Waldo,None; My dataframe looks like that so far when I try: pd.DataFrame.from_dict(order_sheet); I always get a little confused on the base structure of the raw data and not even sure if the dictionary structure is the right way of doing this!
746,1550225635.8047,Mica,"so to generate a DF from a dict, you need a dict with an individual key andall of the values to be a list"
746,1550225659.8049,Waldo,"so date as the key; Then individual lists for the sku, qty and rev?; so a list of lists as the date key value?"
746,1550225827.8063,Mica,I'd remove Sales into a separate DF; so you'd have a dict of date:sales_df
746,1550225894.8076,Waldo,slightly confused... how would that look?
746,1550225914.8081,Mica,"with sales being `DataFrame.from_dict({MV1-XMNY18_revenue: [], MV1-XMNY18_qty: [], MV1-STL_revenue:[], MV1-STL_qty: [], ...})`; that would be a sales DF"
746,1550225929.8086,Waldo,ok
746,1550225942.809,Mica,then you have a dict with the key (date) pointing to the value (sales DF); acitally wait wait; if you have another column for date you could putthem all in the same DF
746,1550226027.81,Waldo,"that is what I was thinking; Hence being a bit confused, sorry!"
746,1550226082.8104,Mica,None; etc etc.; my bad i was being silly :stuck_out_tongue:
746,1550226129.8122,Waldo,ok so effectively split out each metric as sku_metricname and have lists
746,1550226131.8124,Mica,"then you'll have all the data, however you'll be required to convert the nested dicts into a list dict; yup"
746,1550226163.8132,Waldo,ok think I am getting it enough to see how that approach works; will give it a go now quickly
746,1550226176.8138,Mica,hopefully that all makes sense :stuck_out_tongue:
746,1550226209.8143,Waldo,the tricky part is I do not know what the skus will be in the date range I run the report
746,1550226244.8151,Mica,skus?
746,1550226258.8155,Waldo,Sorry - product codes
746,1550226280.8159,Mica,you could put in default stubs and then update

747,1550232458.8208,Ji,"does any one know if there is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your code. It can integrate with your existing workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests (code here is done using pyspark and sparksql)"
747,1550232559.8212,Mica,"code smells you could use something like mypy, black. pep8, isort. etc; as for detecting bugs, you could always run tests in the CI?"
747,1550232620.8222,Hiroko,"automatic?  no; run tests in CI, use linting tools to enforce agreed upon convention; but actual code review?  how would that work?"
747,1550232698.8239,Jonas,I'd say you haven't installed it correctly then :smile:
747,1550232714.8244,Hiroko,how would you determine a less than optimimal approach or a possible better structure?  suggesting documentation?
747,1550232714.8245,Jonas,If you paste the command you're running to install it and the output we can give you a hand
747,1550232780.825,Hiroko,"if you want code analysis, there’s sonarqube; <https://www.sonarqube.org/>; but not sure how well it would work for dynamic languages like python.  I know it works best with static types like java/c#/etc"
747,1550232840.8273,Karoline,"I usually run black, pyflakes, and mypy and then there is manual review"
747,1550232843.8274,Ji,"I am using Sonarqube in golang. But i have not used in pyspark.
For python also there is a plugin. I have not tested it"
747,1550232878.828,Hiroko,"true, but there’s always going to be limitations because of the dynamic nature of the language, particularly if you’re not using typings or mypy; are you using manual code review in addition to this?"
747,1550233035.8294,Ji,Yes i am doing a manual code review. But sometimes when you write the code you might end up with cognitive complexity.; so i want to highlight such things for later refactor
747,1550233249.8309,Karoline,I don't know how much a tool can really help with that.  I mean there's things like mccabe complexity checking - but especially if it's simply advisory and going to be dealt with later I dunno how much having that as an automatic part of a PR would help
747,1550233400.8329,Ji,when i said i would later refactor. it is not left like that. I would address this as soon as possible. you are right using the tool seems useless
747,1550233409.8332,Karoline,If I'm using an automated tool in my PRs it's usually to give me a yes/no answer.; especially just because they avoid argument.  the worst thing is getting people disagreeing about how important something is and a PR dragging on about what should/shouldn't be fixed.
747,1550233753.8376,Ji,"Yes you can use it against every PR but then it becomes an overhead (All PR is done by manual reivew, which is enough).
I would rather keep it simple get the things running and then refactor code based on complexity and performance.
The main usecase for me is to highlight writing a shitty code gives us pain in the end and force people to create better quality (i believe people learn faster when they see something :slightly_smiling_face: )."
747,1550233819.8386,Hiroko,"is that shitty code fairly visible in review or when working on tickets?; eg, when you’re working on a ticket and you come across X thing that could be done better.  why not file a ticket for that, especially if you have a tech debt epic/bucket; and then you can allocate 10-20% of your team’s weekly work to cleaning up those kind of tickets"
747,1550233931.8417,Ji,I do agree with you <@Hiroko> that is the best approach. But sometime some slip through.
747,1550233946.8419,Karoline,that's going to happen
747,1550233989.8432,Ji,So such tooling which just give me overview helps me catch those
747,1550233997.8437,Hiroko,and are you sure you’re going to get a higher signal to noise ratio with thoe tools?
747,1550233999.8439,Ji,I believe SonarQube does that
747,1550234006.8441,Karoline,"I'd say throw the linters and mccabe at it, and use those to gate new PRs.  And anything beyond that is realistically going to have to come from the culture of your dev team"
747,1550234034.8446,Hiroko,and project managers too
747,1550234089.8457,Ji,i just want to help dev team :wink: . Project managers are whole different species :smile:
747,1550234125.8468,Hiroko,PMs really should help the dev team and be the interface between devs and stakeholders
747,1550234131.847,Karoline,"I mean they list their ""code smells"" - <https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Code%20Smell/RSPEC-124>"
747,1550234137.8475,Hiroko,"if theyre not doing that, there’s a bigger problem"
747,1550234145.8477,Karoline,"I'm unimpressed with what it does beyond the normal linter, to be honest"
747,1550234174.8481,Hiroko,files should not have too many lines of code?; doesn’t really state what the limit is
747,1550234203.849,Ji,Thanks guys i will try to keep it simple and do it with linters for start
747,1550234222.8495,Hiroko,cognitive complexity… would be interesting how that’s determined
747,1550234228.8498,Karoline,use the linters and don't make them advisory.  fail PRs that linting; <@Hiroko> my guess is they just run mccabe
747,1550234253.8503,Hiroko,<https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf>; looks to be built off mccabe
747,1550234306.8509,Karoline,"a lot of this just seems to be built off of the existing linters really; another thing I'll add, and I hope I'm not beating a dead horse here, but it's coming a up a lot as I get deeper into the new place I'm at so it's on my mind - anything automated to tell you things that isn't designed to require a response is destined to be ignored.  my prediction is if this is just an advisory thing on your PRs, people start out peeking at what it says, but will begin to ignore it as they realize it has no bearing on whether their work gets merged or not.; worse - they may internalized its continued griping about their ""shitty code"" and get demoralized.; so if you want to integrate tools like this into CI - make failing the tool fail CI"
748,1550235989.8543,Arturo,Managed to get it working. The import name was wrong
747,1550236917.8612,Ji,"Yes you are right people will get demoralised if flagged every single time.
In go project which i worked with we used this check (like a  good to have), not to flag things as shitty code.
Like you said before we sit as a team we take a look into code smell and remove it before moving it into production. I am taking that learning into the new project but this is in pyspark and spark sql. So i wanted to know if Sonarqube is the most recommended or just use the basic linter.
I did realize dev team who is in this is not used to these toolings and code quality. So it is a thin line for making people frustrated."
747,1550236990.862,Karoline,"Yeah it can be especially tough working with data science stuff, the expectations for developers there are often different.  I think it's good to do what you are doing though and trying to bring up the code quality"
749,1550239432.8657,Bethany,"Funny thing, I just talked to two people from the same department. 1) the pyspark queries were slow so I converted them to use mostly SQL since then only the SQL statements need to be transferred. 2) the codebase was all in pyspark using just SQL statements and was unmaintainable so I converted it to python statements; So don't do that"
749,1550239525.868,Ashley,"Yeah. You'll have to work the problem backwards a little bit. Just look at how it builds the command it wants to run, and try to mimic that process"
749,1550239549.8688,Bethany,I can't imagine a tool will be able to tell you anything helpful beyond Flake8 + mypy + formatter (black/yapf).

761,1550373124.9367,Corey,"Hi All, While perusing content from a few different Python courses, I've noticed two distinct patterns in code to deal with default values being assigned to attributes in a class definitions. (refer to the snippet provided)

In the first case, class definition Object_One, a method variable is assigned None. This value is then assigned to the object's attribute upon instantiation.

In the second case, class definition Object_Two, there is no use of a method variable nor the conditional statement reassigning the attribute a value.

In both cases though, when instantiating the two objects and printing the two attributes with and without a value being passed during objects creation, the values are the same. So, the BIG question aside from the probing one asked by the Troll near the Bridge of Death is... what's the difference? Is one version more widely accepted? <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python>; # Python 3.6

class Object_One:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._attribute = kwargs['parameter'] if 'parameter' in kwargs else 'default'

    def object_one_method(self, method_variable = None):
        if method_variable:
            self._attribute = method_variable

761,1550418785.9514,Gianna,<@Hiroko> i already have it
763,1550420168.9519,Leana,Knowing how to ask a good question is a highly invaluable skill that will benefit you greatly in any career. <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> is a good collection of suggestions and strategies to help you structure and phrase your question to make it easier for those here to understand your problem and help you work to a solution.

763,1550431289.9537,Bethany,<@Gianna> do you understand conda environments? You may have installed to a different env. What is the output of `which python` or `where python` and the output of `conda list`
764,1550433864.9543,Delbert,guy do you have any guides on how quickly visualize data from mongodb? I have been thinking to setting up small server using flask. Any tips?
763,1550434266.9559,Gianna,<@Bethany> i think you are rit but how i can fixed it here is my output; None; <@Bethany> i try with this but does not work :disappointed: `pipenv --python path/to/anaconda/bin/python`
763,1550434984.9571,Bethany,"you're using conda, pyenv and pipenv?"
763,1550435020.9575,Gianna,"i am confuse really; u see this; ```which python
/Users/alif/.pyenv/shims/python```"
763,1550435037.9584,Bethany,i can imagine! I'm confused. They all have overlapping things; yes; I've never used pyenv so I don't know what that's doing; what does the prompt say when you do `python`
763,1550435120.96,Gianna,i think if you use `pyenv` u can use multi python version
763,1550435132.9603,Bethany,yes but conda does that too; so I imagine that is a source of confusion
763,1550435150.9611,Gianna,so should i delete all then install again
763,1550435163.9613,Bethany,honestly might be easiest; only use conda for example; or only use pyenv
763,1550435178.9622,Gianna,then what is my 1st
763,1550435178.9623,Bethany,but don't do that just yet; type `python` what do you see
763,1550435202.963,Gianna,"but if use pyenv i cant use anaconda yes?; ```python

763,1550435217.9636,Bethany,"you might be able to use both. I never use pyenv so can't say for sure; looks like python is not pointing to anaconda python, but rather default Apple python (homebrew?); that might be a pyenv thing you need to change"
763,1550435342.9649,Gianna,i have homevrew
763,1550435371.9653,Bethany,"yes, so you must have something like the following in your file system; None; your current setup, which appears to be through pyenv, has `python` pointing to `/bin/python` or whatever it is on mac"
763,1550435490.9666,Gianna,<http://prntscr.com/mmdnwn>
763,1550435523.967,Bethany,"yeah I'm not familiar with MacOS but the idea is the same; you have multiple python's lying around. And the one you get when you type `python` is not what you expect; so you `pip install ...` it is installing to one of the pythons, but not the one you want; does mac have `source .bashrc` or something equivalent?"
763,1550435695.9697,Gianna,<http://prntscr.com/mmdpdh>; <@Bethany> did you see this <http://prntscr.com/mmdoqd>
763,1550435757.9708,Bethany,yes but I have never developed on mac before
763,1550435759.971,Gianna,this is ~/.bash_profile; its bash file
763,1550435784.9716,Bethany,do you `source ~/.bash_profile` to activate it?
763,1550435788.9718,Gianna,yes
763,1550435808.9722,Bethany,I think this may be a pyenv thing then
763,1550435813.9724,Gianna,yes
763,1550435838.9727,Bethany,what does `pyenv version` do
763,1550436031.9731,Gianna,"after commend this line it show me now this; ```#if command -v pyenv 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then
#  eval ""$(pyenv init -)""
#fi```; python -V

763,1550436496.9751,Bethany,"yeah this is probably pyenv overwriting the default python path,  but I don't know that tool well enought to help."

769,1550487093.0011,Vanita,yup

769,1550487156.0027,Chester,You should really return these values explicitly
769,1550487216.0036,Mica,"depends what you mean by information, not sure you could pull varaible values, without a huge amount of work, but you could potentially monitor stuff like runtime and memory usage :thinking_face:"

I’ve a flask app being built thats gonna have a _fairly_ large codebase with a LOT of routes. I know they have `flask routes` through `click` which returns all the routes but you only really get the route, function name and the method. I’d love more info outside of “More descriptive function names”; initially I thought of trying to see could I modify the `@app.route()` decorator to have a `desc` or similar argument that would be pulled somehow but I guess I need to figure out what `flask routes` is calling first"
769,1550487442.0074,Mica,so you want to extend the existing `flask routes` command?; so you can also display a description
769,1550487459.008,Vanita,"or use another command, it doesn’t have to extend"
769,1550487504.0087,Lorinda,Thanks for the continues support on the matter! So the command is the hackrf_spiflash -r and I will need to find out how it is build in order to recreate the process and then call this command?

769,1550487539.0094,Lorinda,How I can find how it builds the command? In your experience what my angle should be in order to find that info for hackrf_spiflash -r?
769,1550487829.0106,Vanita,"honestly its just a string that’ll exist on that endpoint, I know theres a `app.url_map.iter_rules()` but i don’t know enough Python to know if I can extend that or not (or how that’d work tbh)"
769,1550488885.0109,Jettie,"sure you can; you can make a decorator that would do `blueprint.add_route`, and then also take a `desc` argument (and possibly more) and store it in your own dict (like url_map)"
769,1550489447.0126,Vanita,"oh so instead of calling `app.route`, I’d wrap that and give it my own? Interesting!"

Like I said, aside from the `subprocess` and `QtCore` stuff, it's working with standard python objects, so it should be easy to follow what it does. You can either throw in a bunch of print statements between each alone, or try out pdb so you can hang out in there and keep trying stuff without having to keep calling the script over and over"

778,1550513805.0497,Jonas,"<@Cherish> these comments are exposed as `obj.__doc__`, so it's handy for them to be there for auto-generating documentation. It's also convention"
778,1550513806.0499,Deangelo,so looping through dict keys and values; let me check if any of those suggestions will do
778,1550513851.0512,Cherish,thanks <@Jonas> :taco:
778,1550513874.052,Jonas,"In general though, try to avoid concrete comparisons; if you want to iterate through something, try `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Iterable)`; because what if your value changes from a list to a tuple down the road. Your code will still work in theory, but your isinstance check will fail."
778,1550514243.0534,Deangelo,makes sense
779,1550514252.0537,Deangelo,and for dict? do I use the abstract Mapping?
778,1550514257.0541,Jonas,"yep; Be careful though; a string is iterable, but you'd rarely want that; So specific exclusions are fine (`if isinstance(obj, str)`); but in general if you want to iterate over something, check that it's iterable rather than it is a concrete type"
778,1550514309.0559,Deangelo,"I check primitive types first, so this is safe; so I have this:
```
if isinstance(data, Iterable):
        return _deserialize_list(data, klass) # need subclass, like float in List[float]
    elif isinstance(data, Mapping):
        return _deserialize_dict(data, klass) # need subclass here too
```; instead of klass, I need to fetch the sub type, in say `List[subtype]`"
779,1550514829.058,Deangelo,actually nvm
778,1550514849.0584,Deangelo,"I'm having issues with isinstance(data, Iterable) and isinstance(data, Mapping); because I want to also support class models; ```
...
    elif isinstance(data, Mapping):
        return _deserialize_dict(data, klass)
    elif isinstance(data, Iterable):
        return _deserialize_list(data, klass)
    else:
        return deserialize_model(data, klass)
```; the last branch `deserialize_model` never gets triggered because instances of custom classes are also of type Mapping and Iterable; I initially had this:
```
    elif type(klass) == GenericMeta:
        if klass.__extra__ == list:
            return _deserialize_list(data, klass.__args__[0])
        if klass.__extra__ == dict:
            return _deserialize_dict(data, klass.__args__[1])
    else:
        return deserialize_model(data, klass)
```; but it's not compatible with python 3.7"
778,1550515202.0622,Clemmie,"It is a little different, but maybe you could use `functools.singledispatch` and use the logic inside the `Mapping/Iterable` function to differentiate between your models and the base types"
778,1550518634.0639,Deangelo,"I found `typing_inspect`, which can do:
```
is_generic_type(Mapping)
is_generic_type(Iterable[int])
```
I just need the import to work so I can check."

782,1550523575.0835,Tynisha,"Hello everyone, I have been working on an application that uses Django as a backend, but runs a different server to serve a single page application that handles it's own logic, and only references the Django api to send requests and receive Json.

I have run into a lot of trouble regarding Django's security when writing post requests. In particular, I keep getting blocked by an error saying ""(CSRF cookie not set)"" or ""(CSRF token missing or incorrect)"". The ""/at/csrf_exempt"" tag isn't solving the issue, and I can't find a working solution for setting headers in my client side code. Does anyone know a work-around so we can continue with production. We would prefer to use Django security via the token and don't want to have to build our own."
782,1550523708.0839,Jewell,Django needs a bearer token present in the request; so whatever you're using for making the API calls needs to set that token; `Authorization: Bearer &lt;tokenValue&gt;`
782,1550524003.0869,Tynisha,"Thanks for the ideas Ben, but we're currently building out our login page and don't have access to the session storage or cookie data yet. Simply put, we can't log in due to no established cookies."

783,1550526219.0931,Karoline,"essentially normally if you load a form say from Django itself, it'll ensure that a token is injected along with the form, and it expects that when you hit the server that this token will be included to verify the request came from a real session as opposed to a malicious link trying to trick you into doing some action"
783,1550526631.0934,Jonas,Can’t you do this using the ORM?
783,1550526709.0946,Karoline,"Depending on how much effort you want to put in to keeping it, you could potentially either proxy your served JS stuff through Django or have some sort of endpoint for serving csrf tokens I'd imagine."

799,1550585798.1486,Ashley,"No problem. The python function you originally showed me effectively generates a command by adding stuff to a list. There's no fancy objects involved with that part of the function. It's just a standard list using standard list methods (in Python, methods are functions that are ""bound"" to an object). That part also makes up the bulk of the code in that function.

At the end of that function, the list that was generated is then passed to something in `subprocess`, which is how the command is actually run.

Look at how the list is generated, what it looks like just before being passed to that part of `subprocess`, and how it gets passed to that part of `subprocess`. That will tell you exactly how you can make a new function (function != command. ""Function"" means code, while command is something you can in a shell/terminal/command prompt) to do what you want.

I can't get more specific than that without doing the work for you. So if you're not sure how to go about this, you should take a step back and look into what lists are in Python and how to work with them."

799,1550590674.16,Franklyn,"I'm facing an issue using an api I'm working with. I'm trying to figure out how I can poll a task indefinitely. The task relies on having the `BaseClient`s None parameters updated with a `session_token` and `user_id`. These are required for long polling.  Everytime I run get_client it creates a new instance and the login() function gets called and I get captcha'd.
Can anyone help me figure out how I can poll the shared task  `get_balance` ?

799,1550590930.1618,Hiroko,"but `get_balance` doesn’t do that.  It just calls once and exits; remember, a task doesn’t share state unless you specify it; so why not rewrite `get_balance` to run an infinite loop with a sleep interval?"
799,1550591104.1659,Franklyn,"Oh forgot to mention that I have a celery beat scheduler for `get_balance`, my problem is everytime it calls The `BaseClient` it calls a new instance of `BaseClient`. I need to call the `BaseClient` when the class has updated the `session_token` and `user_id`"
799,1550591289.1667,Hiroko,"`apiclient = APIClient(username, password)` is creating a new instance each time; so, if you want that client to persist, make it exist out of the scope of that method; or make APIClient a singleton"
799,1550591694.1704,Franklyn,How can I make it exit out of the scope? The session token expires after 6 hours so the APIClient will need to be updated.

801,1550594990.1759,Tynisha,"Figure I'd follow-up with my prior Django / React CSRF issue I was referencing above. I found a solution by adding this to the top of my App.js file:

```
import cookie from 'react-cookies';

axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName = 'csrftoken';
axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = 'X-CSRFToken';
```

And later in the same file under the 'render()' section including a line saying:

```
&lt;input type='hidden' value={cookie.load(""csrftoken"")} name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' /&gt;
```

Finally, on the Django side under the 'views.py' file in my login app I added:

```
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

@csrf_exempt
```

Hope this helps for anyone else that runs into the same issue."

806,1550629951.1953,Devin,"very random question, does anybody know how to make the output of a `string.replace()` be single quotes? I’m using it on the way to a SQL database and it’s messing things up by using double quotes when it replaces."
806,1550630054.1958,Sasha,"Can you clarify? The quotes around debug output aren't actually present in the string, if that's what you mean."
806,1550630075.196,Devin,"for example; None; and since this is being injected into a SQL statement it’s mucking things up; i’ve noticed that everything is single quotes except for instances where the replace was performed; and to get the SQL to work that would need to be
`'Mary''s Pizza'` instead of `""Mary''s Pizza""`"
806,1550630159.1985,Carmen,Please post a copy of the code doing the replacing.
806,1550630172.1987,Devin,"`r[76].value.replace(""'"", ""''"")`; i’m having a hard time googling this one because it’s tons of results where people want to replace double quotes lol"
806,1550630249.2004,Carmen,And how are you adding it to the SQL? Because what you're doing in the replace shouldn't have anything to do with surrounding quotes.
806,1550630314.2011,Devin,well i’m pulling the example (like in the screenshot) before it’s passed
806,1550630362.202,Carmen,"In that case, we're going to need to see a full copy of the code. What you're describing should not be happening at all from a simple replace operation."
806,1550630448.2022,Devin,"but it is…; lol; in python i know you can interchange `'` and `""` for strings, but is there a way to perhaps force one?; because it seems that the `.replace` function is outputting `""`"
806,1550630731.2044,Carmen,Then show us the code. There is absolutely no way to reproduce what you're seeing without having the code to run.
806,1550630826.2051,Devin,"sure - i was trying to save time. For context I’m loading an excel file and pushing it to a database.; two parts:; None; And this is the function from that `Database` class; None; and I can’t post a screenshot because it’s sensitive info, but I can clearly see that the results of the `.replace` are in double quotes and everything else is in single quotes"
806,1550631129.2089,Sasha,"Are you looking at the print output, or what is ending up in the database?"
806,1550631192.2096,Devin,print output because i haven’t got it to push to the DB yet and the error is super vague; So i was entering the output of the query directly into MSSQL; and when i run it I get an error on those lines
807,1550631658.2128,Hiroko,Do any of the values in these fields contain single quotes?
806,1550631668.2131,Devin,yes - and those end up getting replaced
806,1550631678.2135,Hiroko,"Escape them, then"
806,1550631700.214,Devin,"that’s not the problem, it’s that their entire surrounding string turns from single quotes to double quotes; nothing in the string itself; i mean that might not be it but i’m assuming that’s what it is"
806,1550631860.216,Raguel,what is the error you are getting?
806,1550631871.2166,Hiroko,"Quotes, whether single or double, don't matter to the db "
806,1550631873.2167,Devin,"scratch all of that - a better question for me would be how can I output what is actually being passed to SQL; so say i’m doing this `self.cur.execute(sql, values)`; how can i view the output of that?; other than this? `print(sql, values)`"
806,1550632141.2186,Hiroko,What database ; And have you looked how to escape quotes in sql?
806,1550632233.2203,Devin,"it’s mssql - and yes it’s escaped correctly for sql, but the double quotes surrounding that string is where i’m running into an issue"
806,1550632249.2206,Hiroko,How do you know that?; You haven't said anything about the specifics of the error
806,1550632315.2216,Devin,"because i’m running it in SQL and it’s breaking; for example
`INSERT INTO xyz (f1, f1, f3, f4) ('value 1', 'value two', ""value''s three"", 'value four')`; the double quotes are a no no for MSSQL"
806,1550632367.2239,Raguel,"if you are doing directly in db, MSSQL will throw an error — doing with Python shouldn’t"
806,1550632382.2245,Devin,"ok - so back to my other question how do i see EXACTLY what it is passing?; because maybe it is fine, you’re right"
806,1550632389.2249,Carmen,"Just as a test, I did a minimum-viable check on the replace itself and I'm not getting any surrounding quote issues whatsoever. It has to be something aside from the replace."
806,1550632402.2254,Raguel,What error message are you getting in your python?

806,1550632474.2266,Devin,ok so it must not be the string thing - the error is a generic one so I can’t see on what line it’s breaking; let me grab it 1 sec; that’s why i went over to SQL to try to see what the error was

So here’s what I’m talking about: `soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')` and then in my flask’s main function:

I want something like `souptemp = soup` so that every time the post comes in, I can reset the string to the original version (with the variables) so I can find and replace them all over again.

The problem I’m having is… flask’s main function isn’t an actual loop, so things like `souptemp = soup` only get called once, so the second time I do a POST, the variables aren’t there to get replaced."

824,1550688033.0205,Kristine,"Hey guys, so there’s a system that new customers are going to be added to, and when that happens, it’s going to send a POST to my server with some customer information that I’m putting into a letter, and then printing.

To get this POST, I have a small flask server running, and I’m able to test post data to it just fine.

The letter that I’m putting the customer data into is an HTML file, that I then convert to a PDF so I can print it. I’m using HTML because it was a good option since the letter has some images embedded in it (company logos), so this way we can have it formatted exactly how we want. I already have all of this part figured out.

I store the HTML as a string (using Beautiful Soup), and then I use re to replace the fields which are written as `{DateSold}` `{FirstName}` `{CarrierName}` and `{AttendantName}` with the actual data from the POST. I already have all that figured out too.

**The problem I have is** after I replace the fields once, and save the PDF, and then do a second test POST with different data, it still uses the data from the first test because the fields above aren’t there anymore. I’ve tried storing the original HTML as a second variable, and then rewriting it back to the first one in the main flask function, but since that’s not an actual loop, it only fires once, and isn’t actually helping.

So how can I restore the HTML string after altering it each time a POST occurs so re can do my replacements every time?
I’ll post some of my code in a second so you can see what I’m talking about.; None; So you  can see, I’m trying to alter the souptemp string, then revert it back to the original soup string, so that I can find and replace the fields successfully again (because after this is done, the fields are replaced with the corresponding data).; I’m sure there’s better ways to do some of the things I’m doing here, but this works. I’ll take any advice on improving this anyways."
824,1550688419.0235,Sasha,"I'm suspicious that `souptemp = soup` is just duplicating an object reference, instead of making a copy. Is there a `copy()` method or something like that available?"
824,1550688435.0237,Kristine,"I hadn’t considered that at all; that’s an excellent point; “Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object.” &lt;I think you hit the nail on the head"

824,1550690869.0277,Kristine,"Well this was just how I came up with it in the first place, and then since it hadn’t occurred to me that it was duplicating the object reference, I figured what was happening was it was just doing `souptemp = soup` once, so I figured even if I tried to do that, it would also just do that once.; But now that I loaded in the copy module, and used that to actually make a copy of the string it’s working. Would there be an advantage to me recreating the soup object every time instead?; (which, btw, thanks ed for reminding me object references exist lol)"
824,1550693628.0294,Carmen,"I'm just thinking that if you're doing a replace on the soup object, then recreating it from a pristine template each time lets you avoid dealing with deep copies of things."

828,1550705730.0589,Kristine,"So I made a small flask server that listens for url encoded POSTs from an API that occur every time a new customer is added to a database. I seem to have been mistaken on it being URL encoded though, because when I finally tested it with the site that has the customer data, I apparently returned a 405 (Method not allowed).

So my question is… How can I allow all types of methods, and just log the data, so I can do a test one just to see what method its actually using, and then alter my code accordingly? (Or at least, how can I record incoming data even if it’s not the type of method I’m taking, just so I can figure out what I”m working with?"
828,1550705783.0592,Hiroko,"well, method not allowed means HTTP method; so, that seems to be an issue of how your flask server is hitting that API; eg, if its expecting a POST when only a GET is mapped to that endpoint, you’ll get a 405"
828,1550705911.0615,Kristine,"Well the problem is that I’m not sending anything to their server, it’s the other way around. Their API sends POSTs to my server, and I’m the one that gave them the 405"
828,1550705925.0619,Hiroko,"ah, ok; so, is there a POST handler mapped to the URL?; and is the URL in the mapping correct?"
828,1550705993.0641,Kristine,"Yeah, I just tried changing it from args.get to form.get, waiting for the manager to come back to he can trigger another test from the system."
828,1550705994.0642,Hiroko,"for example, if you map `/some-resource/&lt;uuid&gt;/` and try calling it without the trailing slash, unless its specifically set up to handle that, you can get a 404 or 405"

838,1550758763.1344,Hiroko,"also, <@Jolanda> there’s a <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel here for a more targeted topic"
837,1550759288.1349,Mica,<@Franklyn> you're passing a varialbe that doesn't exist to `get-client`
838,1550759303.1354,Mica,the simpliest way i can think off is passing the `api` instance to the clery task
838,1550759520.1361,Jonas,"I doubt that would work, the values need to be serialised to JSON; I recommend passing the username and password to the celery task"
838,1550759779.1391,Franklyn,The username and password are for updating a third party class and subclass that manage a whole bunch of stuff including request.session. That will add complications
838,1550759890.1396,Jonas,you have those complications already
838,1550759897.14,Hiroko,"problem is, a celery task relies on data that can be serialized and transported"
838,1550759909.1405,Jonas,"the celery task runs in a different process, maybe a different machine at a different time."
838,1550759931.1411,Hiroko,"the worker and task are running separately from the code you’re instanciating an object, so you need to use serialization to pack in data that task needs to run in order to transport it"
838,1550760039.1423,Jonas,and you need to design your systems to work in this way if you want background tasks.; it gets really tricky if the credentials are time-bound as well
838,1550760239.1455,Franklyn,Hmm. For storing login credentials that this APICient relies on within a django project. Is it possible to have them in a django model with rest framework so they can be serialised and de-serialised then passed to the task? Would that be a good approach? I'd like the flexibility to edit the values from the admin page on the fly.
838,1550760342.1459,Jonas,"you seem to be storing sensitive account credentials; be very, very careful with how you handle these usernames and passwords, especially if they are customer details; and, as part of that, store them for as shorter time as possible. Things in databases tend to stay around forever."
838,1550760513.1479,Franklyn,<@Jonas> there not customer details so there's no worry about this.
838,1550760930.1493,Mica,"ye, creating a serialiser makes sense, also maybe a dedicated worker and def a dedicated queue if you're working with credentials, this should make sure those tasks are always executed and not waiting in whatever you're using as the queue handler"
839,1550771655.152,Granville,Does anyone know if it's possible to perform sequential filters using regex? I have the following so far and I'm trying to get to the account_id by performing a second filter on the re.split output:
839,1550771851.1531,Sparkle,"You could just do `re.search('accounts/(\w+)/scopes', text)`; Also is the account id always consistent.  E.g sfdc account ids are always 15 or 18 char"
839,1550772025.1538,Granville,"Hi Aurielle, I'm not sure that'd work because I have an entire list of HTML URIs it would have to go to and filter on the word containing the colon in the end"
839,1550772101.154,Sparkle,So what is the actual expected outcome?; Is it the literal word with a colon or the values in a live page that goes in place of that word
840,1550772909.1544,Deon,what about str.split('/')[-2] ?
839,1550772917.1546,Deon,str being the url
840,1550773156.1565,Henrietta,"What would be the best way to count elements in a list that are like this:
`a = [[numpy array, 0], [numpy array, 1], [numpy array, 9]....,]`; is a simple `for` loop the best or I can make use of `Counter` from `collections`?"
840,1550773664.1599,Arturo,"I have a dictionary like so;

```
type(info_map[ne])
&gt;&gt;dict

I am trying to add a new key value pair like so;

```

```
But I am getting an error. Is this the correct way?"
839,1550773694.1601,Claudine,which error?
840,1550773709.1604,Arturo,"it just doesn't print anything; its really weird, my works code base and it simply doesn't print it"
840,1550773780.1612,Claudine,like you run that and then do `print(info_map[ne]['new_key'])` and no output hm?
840,1550773947.1614,Arturo,yup; really odd
840,1550774002.162,Sasha,Maybe try `repr()` in case it's printing an empty string or something.
839,1550774250.1622,Arturo,still nothing; really odd
840,1550774270.1627,Arturo,when I print the value there is something there
839,1550774292.1634,Clemmie,can you show some surrounding code?
840,1550774306.1637,Arturo,"when I print the keys of;
```
info_map[ne]
```
It shows the keys"
839,1550774393.1638,Deon,not sure I understand the question.. why not len(a) ?; do you need the count of elements inside each list within the list?
839,1550774608.1642,Arturo,None
839,1550774697.1645,Henrietta,"thing is, each element has a numpy array and a number as second element, that corresponds to the element class; I need to count how many of each class there is; I need to do slices of data for a ML training, and have to keep the proportions from the original dataset, that is too huge"
839,1550774844.1658,Sasha,It's not really obvious what is going on here. Where is `ne_name` coming from?
839,1550774852.166,Deon,"so each list looks like [np.array([1,2,3]), 1, 2, 3]?"
839,1550774856.1662,Arturo,that is `ne`; changed it to put on here :see_no_evil:
839,1550774875.1667,Deon,"sorry [np.array([1,2,3]), 1] *"
839,1550774880.167,Henrietta,yes
839,1550774890.1675,Arturo,all the `ne` are `ne_name` on my code
839,1550774911.1681,Clemmie,same for `info_map` vs `RF_info_map`?; it is hard to parse when we need to do on the fly text replacement to read it
839,1550774958.1692,Arturo,"Same thing, have made amendments"
839,1550774966.1693,Henrietta,"I think maybe a for loop is the only way, since Counter can't count lists inside lists by my errors"
839,1550774981.1699,Sasha,And could you show some output?
839,1550775034.171,Deon,class_list = [n[-1] for n in a]
839,1550775054.1719,Clemmie,"If you take it to it’s smallest bit does the problem still show up? Something like this
```
  for ne in info_map.keys():
      if ""UM"" in info_map[ne]:

        site_info = info_map[ne][""SITE_INFO""]
        print repr(info_map[ne]['SITE_INFO'])
```"
839,1550775081.172,Henrietta,"wait, that's it?"
839,1550775159.1728,Sasha,I'll also note that you seem to be mixing Py2 and Py3 `print` syntax. Any chance that's causing things to not print?
839,1550775167.173,Arturo,ah; that could be it; but the `rnc` name still prints and the is py3 syntax
839,1550775227.1739,Deon,run it see if it's what you want
839,1550775244.1741,Henrietta,doing it now
839,1550775288.1746,Sasha,Any chance that the code is actually throwing an exception that is being caught and suppressed by surrounding code?
839,1550775342.1755,Arturo,"it gets to the end of the function. As there is a print statement there saying ""No node name for ne""; sorry I would share more with you, but is my works code and don't want to get in trouble"
839,1550775375.1762,Sasha,Can you share the output?
839,1550775512.1773,Arturo,"```
print rnc_name
RNC201
print info_map[ne].keys()
['UM', 'GB']
```
They rest doesn't print anything"
839,1550775546.1776,Sasha,So it doesn't print `this is site info`?
839,1550775566.1779,Arturo,nope which is really bizarre
839,1550775701.1793,Sasha,"Something is broken in your model of what's going on, I think. Like, it's actually running a different version of the code than what you're editing, or something odd like that. I'd shut everything down and then reload your environment, etc."

841,1550776809.1871,Ashley,that's actually a pretty solid writeup. Nice link <@Clemmie>! :taco:
841,1550776839.1877,Clemmie,"There are also other solutions - Docker containers, VMs etc. but as a base case, and pretty much all the time you want to be using virtual envs; then it get’s into a big discussion of how to manage them - but we can help walk you through that once you have a good handle on _what_ and _why_ they are"
841,1550777023.1931,Ashley,"<@Cheri> bundling everything together can mess with how python expects to find resources. Typically, people specify their package's dependencies in their `setup.py` file, which is a complex system you don't need to worry about at the moment. What it does is basically tell `pip` to install those dependencies before installing your package itself. So when you run `pip install some_package`, you'd see it install `dependency_a` and `dependency_b` first, and then install `some_package`, all automatically; bundling them together also means a lot of extra code in the package, and the potential for a lot of duplications of packages existing for the same environment"
842,1550778677.1953,Genaro,"Is `setup.py` preferred over `requirements.txt`? I guess setup.py is used for packaging/distributing/deploying the app but for ""solo hack projects"" requirements.txt is good enough?"

842,1550779564.1972,Carmen,"<https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3uzl2a/setuppy_requirementstxt_or_a_combination/cxj4mdn/> is a good explanation of the differences.; Basically, if you're expecting to `pip install` your project somewhere, and it has dependencies that also need to be installed, you want to put those dependencies in `setup.py`.; If you're just listing out your dependencies for a project that people will fork and use, but not install via pip, general community expectations are `requirements.txt` as the de-facto standard for listing your dependencies."

847,1550815021.2288,Sasha,Cool. Yell if you run into trouble with that part.
847,1550815102.2298,Stacy,"i did get the symbol quoted easily enough because i'm adding that part in as part of the process.  i think the only other part is the date/time stamp which may a bit trickier

```
for m_row in msft_data:
    m_symbol = '""MSFT""'
    m_row.insert(0,m_symbol)
    s = "","".join(m_row)

847,1550815317.2313,Sasha,"Can you clarify what rule you would like to use for quoting values? If you can specify what type of thing should be quoted or not, you can filter on that characteristic in code."
847,1550815449.2319,Stacy,"i think i just want the lines to look like this:  `""MSFT"",""2019-01-31 09:35:00"",103.9200,104.4800,103.5800,104.4300,4252406`; so the symbol and date/timestamp being strings, the rest are integer/floats.; so can probably do something with m_row[0] or m_row[1] (after adding the symbol) and quote that; before converting to a string; got it.  now i can go to bed.  thanks again <@Sasha>!

I'd be a bit careful about some of the advice at those links - things like ""Keep your local machine in the timezone of your server for local testing"" seem like a recipe for disaster.; keep everything in UTC, and only covert to local time as a presentation detail.; Also the ""keep things in a consistent format"" seems dangerous too.  We have ISO 8601, use that, or a epoch timestamp.; There's no need for ad-hoc time formats"

`0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/fileserver/printletters.py &gt; printletters-output.log 2&gt;printletters-errors.log`; And lastly, I'd set up a temporary crontab entry that runs it 2 minutes in the future, so you can get immediate feedback on what's happening."

868,1550955028.3747,Dawn,"Anyone here working with pyMongo? Trying to iterate over a large MongoDB collection in batches with the find_raw_batches() method, but it looks like it still pulls the full collection in memory and creates an iterator with the batch sizes. This makes my memory usage explode. Would be great to figure out a way to actually only pull in one batch at a time, handle the batch, lose the batch out of memory and then go back to the server for a new batch :thinking_face:

You can find the documentation here: <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/collection.html#pymongo.collection.Collection.find_raw_batches>. If we take this code, the count_documents already output all documents (more than the set batch_size), which tells me everything is already in memory before the loop.

Any ideas?
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import bson
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor = db.test.find_raw_batches()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cursor.count_documents)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for batch in cursor:
...     print(bson.decode_all(batch))

868,1550955704.3757,Ashley,"maybe it functions like a generator, and by printing `cursor.count_documents`, you're forcing it to resolve and load everything into memory?; I'm not familiar with mongodb, but that's just my guess"
868,1550955970.3766,Dawn,Hm that's possible. But how would you check that :stuck_out_tongue:

884,1551033998.4385,Reggie,"hi guys, somehow i have the feeling that i am totally overthinking a solution for a problem. i'm doing some exercises and there is one about 2 arrays. the first array is representing the size of a fish and the second array represents their direction (it can be just 0 or 1). if the fishes are swimming the same direction, they will never meet and therefore never eat each other. the bigger fish is always eating the smaller fish and so on and  so on.

for example, given those arrays:
```  A[0] = 4    B[0] = 0
  A[1] = 3    B[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2    B[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1    B[3] = 0
  A[4] = 5    B[4] = 0```

you have to find out how many fish will survive. there is just one fish swimming in the opposite direction, which is fish A[1]. this fish will eat fish A[2] and A[3] but will be eaten by fish A[4].
therefore only 2 fish (A[0] and A[4]) will survive as they are swimming in the same direction and will never collide.
i was thinking of a for loop in the very beginning..but if i do that and for example fish A[1] would eat the A[4]..i would never hit the fish A[0] again. i started thinking of a while loop and so on... does someone has an idea? i hope its more or less clear - otherwise please feel free to ask :man-shrugging::pray: thanks!"
883,1551034434.4396,Sasha,"The problem is a little bit unclear. Is there an ordering to events? Like, what happens if A[0] eats A[1] before A[1] would normally eat A[2] and A[3]?"
883,1551034570.4415,Reggie,"its going always ""down the river"". as the fish A[1] is the first going into the other direction, it is supposed to catch first the [2] and [3] and then hitting the [4] and then from beginning [0] and so on. also, each size of every which is unique. so there will be never 2 fishes with the same size."
883,1551034697.4423,Sasha,"Ah, so the index indicates the relative position in the river, which is preserved until they meet?"
883,1551034757.4433,Reggie,"exactly :slightly_smiling_face: and the river is supposed to be kind of a circle, so sooner or later they gonna ""meet"""
883,1551035238.4449,Sasha,"Gotcha. Yeah, a single `for` loop probably won't do it. I'd be thinking in terms of a dynamic data structure where you remove eaten fish from the list and then re-evaluate the situation repeatedly."
883,1551035482.4482,Reggie,"but at the point you get to the end of the list, you would need to get back to the beginning. in sense of, if the fish at position [2] is going to eat all the rest to the end of the line but the fish at position [0] or [1] would eat fish [2]... how would you work that out? i was thinking of restructuring the array, so fish[2] would move to position [0] and ""eat up"" until it hits a bigger fish which then gets to position [0]? it seems to be very complex"
883,1551035924.4497,Sasha,"For the wrap-around, you could use a modulus operator. Like, to evaluate fish `n` versus fish `n+1`, you'd actually check against `(n+1) % len`."

890,1551063947.4829,Hai,"it says data must be pandas dataframe not &lt;class list&gt;; after that i did plot = sns.pairplot(columns, hue='target'), size=2.5) # 'target' is the column name which is the '0' which we are adding in the code"
890,1551064083.4833,Sasha,"Yeah, that's not going to work. The `columns` is just a parameter to pass to `iloc()` to select which columns you want, it's not the data itself to be plotted."
890,1551064185.4836,Hai,"then after that how would i make the pieces of data to dataframe ?; so ""columns"" has pieces of columns out of 200 right?? so how would i make that pieces of data to pandas dataframe so that i can do sns.pairplot if i have the data in dataframe"
890,1551064428.484,Sasha,"In your original code, you were selecting columns to plot by using `0:10`, right? The `columns` variable is a replacement for that specification... it's an explicit list saying you want columns 0, 11, 12, etc. instead of ""0 through 10"", that's all."
890,1551064729.4844,Hai,"so it will be like ?
data_slicing = data.iloc[:, columns]  ?"
890,1551064801.4846,Sasha,Yep
890,1551064895.4848,Hai,"afte that i did this sns.pairplot(data_slicing, hue=''target"", size=2.5) i got the error # could not broadcast input array from shape(20000, 2) into shape (20000)"
890,1551064963.485,Sasha,"You'll have to ask someone else about that... I don't know anything about `sns`, I'm afraid."
890,1551065133.4852,Hai,"seaborn pair plot this generally accepts dataframe in the dataframe we should give some target column whch we want to determine in the graph. in my case i have 200columns and am splitting into pieces with adding the first 0th column as target to all the pieces so i basically need a for loop of pieces with the target. so can i assume the ""columns"" varibale is one a piece? then can i convert it into dataframe and do sns.pairplot?"
890,1551065402.4855,Sasha,Does the pairplot work if you use your original `0:10` column specification?
890,1551065491.4857,Hai,"yes it works for the first 10columns 0:10 because it has the target in the 0th colum itself so it works, when it comes to 11:20 it doesnt have any target because target is at 0th column so it fails so basically i need to target to each piece i tried pandas merge,join,concat nothing worked"
890,1551065602.4859,Sasha,Maybe print `data_slicing` to see if you can spot any weirdness in it?
890,1551066041.4866,Hai,i think it worked. so i did like this after data_slicing pd.DataFrame(data_slicing) then it made it into dataframe and then worked. Thank you so much <@Sasha> appreciate it
890,1551066086.4868,Sasha,Cool
891,1551067272.491,Marth,"90% of all my scripts are for myself (automation).  I'm working on a project that I'm going to provide to friends.  Internally I'm managing pandas dataframes...but I'm not sure how to present that to the end user.  I'm looking to put filters at the top of whatever interface and the dataframe info below (which then updates as the filters are changed).  The last step, once filtered as the user wants is to hit ""go"" (or whatever button).  I'm not sure if this can/should be done in Tkinter? django? Other?

893,1551074148.4938,Sasha,"You're initializing it from a regular dict, which doesn't preserve order. You should pass in like a list of tuples or something.; (Though actually regular dicts should preserve order too in recent Py3 versions.)"

Hey guy does this meet pep8 guide or is there a more pythonic way to do it? I feel like its not very pythonic"
894,1551076475.4979,Sasha,"I'd consider a `try` block there, catching `AttributeError` and `KeyError`, mainly because the repetition annoys me. But it's a question of style.; Personally, I would try to at least guarantee that `param` exists earlier in the code, creating an empty dict if it doesn't, since object attributes normally are an API invariant. Then you could use `get('is_default_agent_name', False)` in cases like this as a one-liner, for the leftover uncertainty."

895,1551082330.5077,Gianna,so after load page it will take image then reload page take src string; done; aleady; its work but copy same image src string
895,1551082445.5085,Sasha,"Well, you're asking for the same element in the same page, so it would be the same image. Do you need to request a different URL to get another image?"
895,1551082466.5087,Gianna,no same url; just need to reload page; or refresh
895,1551082584.5093,Sasha,So do that. There's a `driver.refresh()` function in Selenium for that.
895,1551088318.51,Gianna,thanks
896,1551093441.5112,Lourie,which is best way to add logs on different libraries that i use in my django app?

898,1551109863.5522,Joette,you can replace the index; `df.index = some_new_index`; maybe `df.index = pd.Index(list(range(len(df.index))))`

898,1551110004.5549,Weldon,I have tried using different regions but not getting the desired results
898,1551110089.5551,Clemmie,Do you have multiple monitors?; Also what OS are you using?; You can start to see if it is in the right place using `pyautogui.size()` it should return the size in pixels of your monitor
898,1551110755.5577,Weldon,No I have only one monitor and i am using Ubuntu 18.0.4LTS
898,1551110812.5583,Clemmie,Is it giving you the right size of your monitor with with `pyautogui.size()`?
898,1551110829.5585,Weldon,Yes.
899,1551110845.559,Clemmie,And you have a window open on that screen?
898,1551110862.5592,Weldon,Yes.; What should i do?
898,1551110902.5598,Clemmie,and `im.show()` is just showing you a black picture; sorry `img1.show()`; <@Weldon> it looks like this may be a known and outstanding issue with pyautogui <https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/issues/280>
898,1551111237.561,Jonas,"&gt; I think the problem is that pyautogui doesn't come to terms with wayland yet, the x11 substitute.; If you're trying to make a poker bot, there are way better ways than reading the screen; that's..... going to be hard."
898,1551111303.5621,Clemmie,best bet is probably intercepting/injecting  json
898,1551111329.5627,Jonas,:point_up_2: if you're struggling to capture the screen just wait until you need to do object detection
898,1551111394.5637,Clemmie,"<@Jonas> possibly not though. With a known set of assets pyautogui can actually search for matches and get the screen location; Still not great, but tractable"
898,1551111837.5665,Keena,"i am getting issue as ""sublist parameters are not supported in python 3"" at part of lambda(v, k). do any one know how to solve this?"
898,1551111867.5673,Weldon,Thanks guys. I will try again with json and xpath.
898,1551112080.5698,Clemmie,"<@Keena> In python 3 a lambda doesn’t take multiple params. You need to access the params as a list, so `return sorted(dict_of_word_count.iteritems(), key=lambda v_k: (v_k[1],v_k[0]), reverse=True)[0:20]` should work I think (found at <http://cheng.logdown.com/posts/2016/11/30/python3-lambda-parameter>)"

898,1551112676.5714,Clemmie,"if you want to sort on the values that should work I think, yes; but you switch the name `v_k` and `k_v` - jsut keep that variable name consistent; `k_v` is more correct"
898,1551112767.573,Keena,"actually I got that code snippet on web as lambda(v, k): (k, v), reverse=True; so I thought about doing that thing; what do you say?"
898,1551112861.5751,Clemmie,"Right, but now you are naming one variable, not multiples. Before you named them so you could sort on them in reverse (v,k -&gt; k,v), now it is just one and you are using the list index to pick them out; `iteritems()` gives a them as `(key, value)` so `k_v` is most internally consistent"
898,1551112971.5763,Carmen,<@Marth> Are your friends technical? Are you expecting them to run the script? Visit a webpage? The exactly workflow you want your friends to follow to get the data will help dictate what tools make the most sense.
898,1551113079.5764,Keena,got your point. trying out the thing which you explained.thank you buddy.
898,1551113094.5766,Clemmie,:thumbsup:
898,1551113806.5839,Marth,"<@Carmen> They're gamers....so while certainly computer savvy, not ""technical""  in the sense that I'm not expecting them to edit the script.  I'm expecting them to run the script which will provide an interface. That interface is going to list their twitch clips and allow them to sort/filter and then download those clips.  Currently, (as I'm told) filtering and sorting their clips is really bad....and then Twitch DOES allow them to download their clips, but it takes 3+ clicks per clip.  So I'm trying to help automate that process.  I'm not sure if a local .exe with gui or a webpage makes more sense."
898,1551113981.5844,Jimmy,Well it depends if you are familiar with any of the two
898,1551114085.5857,Carmen,"I think you could honestly use either for that. If you've got webdev experience, doing it as a webapp might be easier than learning GUI programming, but if you'd have to learn either, I'd probably argue this particular app makes more sense as a local exe with GUI."
898,1551114986.5864,Marth,awesome.  Thanks!  That's helpful! <@Carmen> :taco:
901,1551115058.5866,Mica,you could use something like Electron; basically a local desktop application built with web tech
898,1551115180.588,Carmen,"<https://www.pyinstaller.org/> is also an option, if you want to keep it mostly-Python"
901,1551115190.5882,Leopoldo,"Hello all, I want to alternate capital and lowercase letters into a new array. The way I could think of to capitalize letters was breaking the original word into two arrays. I want to join them back but alternate the letters when I do so.

I keep running into the error and am stumped. If anyone could lend some advice, I would appreciate it.

if i % 2 == 0:
TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting"
901,1551115222.5889,Marth,"Thanks <@Mica> I'll look into that as well...I'm sure I can google it, but do you happen to know what python libraries/modules I should google for that?  Or is that outside of python itself?"
902,1551115331.5897,Jonas,"<@Leopoldo> `"""".join(c.upper() if i % 2 else c.lower() for i, c in enumerate(word))`"
901,1551115371.5901,Jonas,"also the error you have given us is not the one you are experiencing, you are not doing string formatting"
898,1551115437.5909,Sasha,"Note that `for i in word` iterates over the characters in the string, not their index position."
901,1551115512.5919,Leopoldo,<@Jonas> thank you. I’ll play with that and try to understand. What does the c in enumerate(word) do?
898,1551115542.5926,Hiroko,"`enumerate` is a generator that for each iteration, returns a tuple of index, value; `i` is the index of the location currently being looked at"
901,1551115575.5938,Leopoldo,<@Sasha> ok so I wouldn’t need to create an array if it’s going to iterate over each character in a string?
898,1551115578.5939,Hiroko,`c` is the variable name for the value at that index location
901,1551115592.5944,Clemmie,<@Leopoldo> a string is already a list of characters
901,1551115602.5946,Leopoldo,<@Hiroko> Thank you for explaining that
901,1551115655.5958,Sasha,"Well, I was more explaining why `i % 2` was giving you that error. In your code, `i` is a character, not a number."
901,1551115689.5964,Leopoldo,"<@Clemmie> ok thanks; Ok that makes sense, thank you <@Sasha>; If I wanted to use i % 2, then I could combine that with say len(word); And define i = 0"
901,1551115887.5992,Sasha,"Yes, you could do `for i in range(len(word))`. No need for the `i = 0`, since the `for` loop initializes it anyway. But I'd suggest you think about `enumerate` more... it's a nice elegant solution to have access to both the character and its position in your loop."
901,1551115948.5999,Leopoldo,Thank you for that for that @ <@Sasha>. I will do some more research.
898,1551116257.6006,Carmen,"<@Marth> Electron is based on Node.js and Chromium. So there won't be Python involved at all, really."
898,1551116299.6008,Marth,gotcha
901,1551116857.6022,Leopoldo,I don’t understand how to implement your suggestion. I’ve tried a couple of different ways but am failing so far. <@Jonas>
903,1551116964.6031,Candra,`bird = ''.join()`; and; also; you have it all in a for loop
901,1551117038.6045,Clemmie,<@Leopoldo> you are mixing a few different concepts that each could do it themselves and getting twisted up. The easiest way is:
903,1551117072.6051,Clemmie,"```
def myfunc(word ='TEST'):
    return """".join(c.upper() if i % 2 else c.lower() for i, c in enumerate(word))
      
myfunc()
```"
903,1551117077.6052,Candra,None
901,1551117088.6057,Leopoldo,Thank you <@Candra> That was helpful for me
903,1551117091.6059,Candra,Yep; <@Clemmie> has the same thing; :slightly_smiling_face:
901,1551117119.6074,Leopoldo,<@Clemmie> Thank you. I didn’t realize it could be done so simply.
903,1551117160.6084,Leopoldo,I can see my attempt was getting confusing. Now that it’s working I’ll take time to understand it a little.; What does the ‘’.join() stand for?
903,1551117199.6095,Clemmie,"That way <@Candra> and I showed uses a list comprehension in the `join` call. List comprehensions are basically for loops for free, when you want the result to be a list; `str.join()` takes a list of strings and joins them into one string, with the str you called join on in between; so `','.join(['1','2','3'])` would result in `""1,2,3""`"
903,1551117277.6117,Hiroko,"and you did this by initiating an empty string with `''`; which made the `join` method available, because that’s part of the string type"
901,1551117363.6131,Leopoldo,"Thank you both <@Clemmie> <@Hiroko> You two rock, you’ve helped me a few times before and I really appreciate your patience and explanations."
904,1551121426.615,Demetrice,"I'm writing a function that takes in an input from the user and inputs that into a string. But when the user input is blank i want it to default to the word ""you"" However i can't get it to do that."
904,1551121584.6154,Clemmie,what have you tried?
904,1551121705.6158,Demetrice,"Actually i think i just figured it out. This seems to be working; I think i just needed to define Name before the if statement; Name = input(""What is your name?"")
if Name == '':
    Name = 'you'
def two_fer(name='you'):
    return(""One for %s, one for me."" %Name)
print(two_fer())"
904,1551121782.6172,Clemmie,"Well, the first issue is that you are referencing two different variables `Name` != `name`; also, generally you don’t want to use uppercase for variable names.; given what you have, with me not changing variable names, you want to pass `Name` in the call to `two_fer()` and in the return you want to use the variable `name` which is scoped to the function"
904,1551121938.6197,Demetrice,So i made some minor changes and now this does seem to do what it's supposed to; But how can i make it better?
904,1551121953.6202,Clemmie,lets see
904,1551121957.6204,Demetrice,"name = input(""What is your name?"")
if name == '':
    name = 'you'
def two_fer(name='you'):
    return(""One for %s, one for me."" %name)
print(two_fer())"
904,1551122006.621,Clemmie,so your scoping is still wrong - if you input “Hello” it will still print out “you”
904,1551122054.6216,Demetrice,By scoping what line are you referring to? I thought it would only print out you if the user inputs a blank
904,1551122061.6217,Clemmie,"This passes the `name` that the user input to the method `two_fer`; No, because you were calling the method without a parameter, which will then used the default parameter in the method signature(`def two_fer(name='you'):`)"
904,1551122148.6232,Demetrice,I see what you're saying; Because i left it blank on the print statement in the bottom it would always default to the you that i put in the def statement; I getya i getya. Thank you; What else did i do wrong?
904,1551122194.6254,Clemmie,"You handled the blank case in your `if` logic, and the default is handling the `None` case if no parameter (or `None`) is passed to the method; otherwise it is fine"
904,1551122248.6277,Ashley,"you can also do `if not name`, because `""""` is falsey"
904,1551122248.6278,Demetrice,Gezz. Such a simple assignment. Hard to believe i was doing so much wrong. Thank you so much for the help
904,1551122256.6281,Clemmie,"If you only wanted to mutate the `name` if name is blank for the `two_fer` method you could do the check for `''` inside the method; <@Ashley> is correct, but be aware that a lot of things are falsey, including `0` and `False`, also the time midnight and empty iterators. Take that into account if you are using falsey checking"
904,1551122389.6312,Demetrice,Okay. In the interest of learning i don't actually know how to use if not to check to see if a user input a value; I'm looking up the syntax for that now
904,1551122464.6327,Cherish,"&gt;also the time midnight
how do you get midnight to evaluate falsey? do datetime objects representing midnight evaluate to false?"
904,1551122571.6329,Clemmie,"None; Datetime objects are ok because of the date portion; ^ is true as of at least 3.4, there was some talk about changing it later, but I can’t find a reference if it has"
904,1551122680.6349,Cherish,"ah ok, I always end up using datetime's so I never actually realized this^"
904,1551122705.6354,Ashley,<https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html> here's a general list
904,1551122728.6359,Clemmie,"Yeah, it is one of those fun edge cases. Shows up with some regularity in new years type checks"
904,1551123930.6377,Cherish,"looks like that might have been changed actually <@Clemmie> -- I'm on 3.7.2 and not getting that behavior, although I haven't seen this mentioned in a changelog equivalent anywhere

904,1551124149.6389,Clemmie,Nice - I am so glad they fixed that. I’m going to have to retire that gotcha
904,1551124328.6399,Demetrice,"So for my next task. I'm writing a panagram tester. And while it works when i run the module it's failing a lot of the test conditions and i can't identify why; Here It is; def is_pangram(sentence):
    alphabet = ''
    alph = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ""
    sentence = input(""What is the string we would like to test?"")
    for i in sentence:
        if i in alph:
            alphabet += i
        else:
            pass
    alphabet = alphabet.lower()
    if ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" in alphabet:
        return True
    else:
        return False
print(is_pangram(sentence = '')); So i'm not sure if it's similar to earlier. I tried just calling sentence as is, in my print statement. and then i tried to just use a default argument instead in the def statement but that also didn't work; Update -- I defined sentence outside of the function and that helped out. But i'm still failing 4/10 cases"

904,1551124572.6434,Demetrice,Very cool. Thank You
904,1551124608.6443,Sasha,"You seem to be expecting that the `alphabet` string will remove duplicates and sort itself automatically, or else you're misunderstanding how `in` works."
904,1551124661.6451,Demetrice,"Good point. I know how to fix the duplicates; I thought by using ""in"" the order wouldn't matter; Do i need to make a list of each alphabet character? That would work, right?"
904,1551124726.6465,Sasha,"For strings, `in` does a substring match, like finding a word in a sentence.; Personally I'd be thinking a `set` would be the easiest way to go."
904,1551124866.6473,Demetrice,So will this work? Although i imagine there's probably a much better way
904,1551124904.6481,Sasha,Afraid not... `in` just doesn't do that. You'd need to loop over each letter and check it one at a time.
904,1551124940.6487,Demetrice,"So if i'm looping then i can have it as one big string again, right?"
904,1551124955.6489,Sasha,Yes
904,1551124981.6493,Clemmie,also you don’t want to put the `= ''` in your method call. that is calling is_pangram with the  empty string every time; just call `is_pangram(sentence)`; :taco: <@Sasha>
904,1551125282.6501,Demetrice,"Would this work?; Also, doing it this way there's no longer a reason to be wary of duplicates in alphabet, right?"
904,1551125380.6518,Sasha,"I don't think string subtraction is a thing, unfortunately, in your `test -= i` line."
904,1551125396.6523,Demetrice,Oh. Man; Also i'm getting a syntax error for 'is not in'. How do we say that in python?
904,1551125428.6538,Carlo,"just ""not in"""
904,1551125434.6541,Carmen,^
904,1551125480.6549,Carlo,"""is"" is an identity test"
904,1551125736.6569,Demetrice,"So i rewrote it. But i think the second if statement is redundant, and doesn't solve the issue of things being out of order"
904,1551125785.6581,Clemmie,"<@Demetrice> you don’t need to do all of the work you are doing  (perhaps) if a pangram is defined as having at least every letter from the alphabet, but can have duplicates (an maybe even other stuff) you don’t need to create your alphabet. Conceptually all you need is to see if all of your test characters (the real alphabet) exist in  your sentence. If they do - return true, if you can’t find one - return false; think about that a little and see if it changes your algorithm; Then we can talk about more performant, pythonic ways to do it, if you want"

905,1551126566.662,Clayton,What is the recommened choices for configuring the python interpreter for pycharm.   venv or conda for envs and for the system interpreter
904,1551126569.6621,Clemmie,you forgot `()` after your call to `lower` so `for i not in sentence` is trying to run on the build-in method `lower` not the string returned from a call to `lower()`
904,1551126588.6625,Lillia,"That looks _much_ better; I recommend removing the `else`, it's confusing."
904,1551126608.6632,Clemmie,"But otherwise that is exactly what I was hoping you would get; If you want to go for really performant, take a look at `set` comparisons"

907,1551134992.67,Nikki,I'm having a git issue :confused:
907,1551135014.6707,Hiroko,git got you?
907,1551135029.6711,Nikki,I commit changes but got a warning a file was too big - I deleted it and tried again but it keeps saying the same error like the file is still there; github; i then did git stash and tried again but just getting the same; is there a way to clear it and start again without losing my local changes
907,1551135155.6726,Hiroko,how big a file; git really isn’t made for large file storage; might want to either offload that elsewhere or check into Github Large File Support
907,1551135199.6742,Nikki,it was just a testing file - I didn't need it so just deleted it
907,1551135204.6744,Hiroko,"and when you deleted the file, did you delete it from the cache; eg `git rm --cached &lt;file-name&gt;`?"
907,1551135333.6753,Nikki,I tried that it I got a fatal path error no file found
907,1551135348.6755,Candra,git stash pop; then git rm --cached filename
907,1551135475.6761,Nikki,it's now saying no local changes; ffs; have I lost my work? I've not done any pull requests etc
907,1551135563.677,Lillia,Did you checkout?
907,1551135568.6772,Nikki,no
907,1551135584.6776,Lillia,Did you stash and not pop?
907,1551135640.6778,Nikki,Yea I did a stash first
907,1551135663.678,Lillia,Yeah so all your changes are stashed?; So they wouldn't show up unless they are untracked
907,1551135722.6786,Nikki,what should I do now/; unstash and then stash pop and start again?
907,1551135797.6794,Lillia,"Yeah try to unstash; theoretically you shouldn't have been able to commit the too-big file; Oh `unstash` is equivalent to `pop`, if I understand what you're saying by `unstash`"
907,1551135919.6803,Nikki,no stash found
907,1551135940.6805,Lillia,:grimacing:
907,1551135993.6807,Nikki,oh dear; this is one of those moments you learn a hard lesson; I've not done a commit in over a week
907,1551136054.6819,Lillia,Ouch; <http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/>
907,1551136067.6824,Nikki,is there anything else you can think of to try?
907,1551136090.6829,Lillia,"If it's not in stash and it's not sitting unstaged or committed, then no. git will happily delete things if you tell it to."
907,1551136170.6842,Nikki,doesn't make sense - I've just copied the file which I had opened and resaved it and git status is saying directory is clean nothing to commit
907,1551136182.6844,Lillia,"What do you mean ""resaved"""
907,1551136326.6851,Nikki,I don't know I'm confused lol
907,1551136346.6855,Lillia,Like in the IDE/editor?
907,1551136356.6859,Nikki,my local changes are still here so why doesn't git see them
907,1551136378.6862,Lillia,"Git won't lie, an editor/IDE might"
907,1551136601.6864,Nikki,there are defo there; on my server where my git file is the changes are there but a git status says there is nothing; wtf lol; I've just added `# test` to the file and the change was picked up
907,1551136673.6879,Lillia,Sounds like the changes are already committed; can you do `git log -p`
907,1551136740.6882,Nikki,not sure what I'm looking at
907,1551136822.6888,Lillia,`-p` shows the changes; you can scroll down and look for the ones that you think are missing
907,1551136987.689,Nikki,sadly nothing helpful
907,1551137014.6897,Lillia,Darn
907,1551137024.6899,Nikki,is there a way to just force add all files that haven't been modified; my server seems fine just no changes in my repository on github
907,1551137078.6907,Lillia,I guess I'm confused as to the setup; I thought this was local.
907,1551137259.6909,Nikki,sorry mate; one last message; Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
907,1551137320.6923,Lillia,Oh you never pushed; Unless you don't want to; In which case you can soft reset
907,1551137340.6931,Nikki,this is basically my issue - when I've tried to push the change the 'big' file has caused an issue when I pushed it - so I deleted it and then tried again
907,1551137423.6944,Lillia,"Ah so deleting doesn't remove it from history, so it's still there. You'll get the warning even though it's ""deleted"". Do `git reset --soft HEAD~2` and then re-commit what you want.; Don't forget the `--soft`; Sorry this would have been avoided if I'd asked what you did originally"
907,1551137544.6954,Nikki,so this will alter my git file only?; I'm scared haha
907,1551137565.6958,Lillia,"Yes, `--soft` preserves the changes.; `--hard` discards them"
907,1551137645.697,My,"if you did git add but didn't commit, your changes MIGHT be in the reflog; be aware that digging in the reflog is for last-hope cases since it's kind of tricky; <http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#panic>"
907,1551137691.698,Nikki,It's worked; you are amazing; thanks so much I was shitting myself lol
907,1551137759.6991,Lillia,I am more persistent than I am smart; Glad nothing was lost :smile:
907,1551137789.6997,Nikki,me too. phew
908,1551139942.7004,Demetrice,So i don't even know how to conceptualize this solution. And it's supposed to be one of the easier ones; have any of you guys ever worked through the python track on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>?
908,1551140230.702,Maricruz,What's the recommended library for parsing xml these days? bs4?
908,1551140291.7028,Sasha,"<@Demetrice> not that site in particular, but I've had fun with Advent of Code and Project Euler recently. If you're looking for a hint, the channel can probably provide one if you post the problem."
908,1551140583.7033,Demetrice,I just don't really know where to start with this one. i understand that i'm probably creating a class. But i don't know how to meet the requirements; None
908,1551140694.7044,Sasha,"If you haven't already, have a look at the `random` library. It has some functions which will help."
908,1551140730.7048,Demetrice,So i imagined that i would use randint to meet the random requirement; But i'm not sure how to make sure they're unique. I guess i can do an if statement to where if they're equal to each other i have the program try again?
908,1551140833.7062,Sasha,"Yeah, you'll need to keep track of all the live names to compare against."
908,1551141483.7065,Demetrice,Does this line of code mean anything to you?; The test sheet has it and i don't know what to make of it; name_re = r'^[A-Z]{2}\d{3}$'; Is that the format to create the first random name assigned to each robot?
908,1551141737.7088,Sasha,"Yeah, that's a ""regular expression"". It says there should be two uppercase letters followed by three digits. Python's `re` library can match strings against those types of patterns, though you don't have to use it here."
908,1551141790.7091,Demetrice,"It sounds like it would make things easier tho, right?; Is that the pythonic way to meet that requirement? What i don't understand is that the test document doesn't have re imported"
908,1551141837.7103,Sasha,"Not really easier for you... it's good for checking the answers, but not creating the strings in the first place."
908,1551141852.7105,Demetrice,Okay that makes sense actually; It's looking to make sure it matches that format. But it's not going to create it on it's own thats my job
908,1551141876.7113,Sasha,Exactly.
908,1551141916.712,Demetrice,"So i guess i concatenate a string including random with all the numbers uppercased + rand int for the letters; But even after that i have to check to ensure it's unique; And then i do all this in the section of the code where i'm creating the class, right?; I think i'm too intimidated by it. I'm gonna give it a shot"
908,1551141998.714,Sasha,Baby steps. Start by writing a function to generate a random name. Then write some code to keep track of names and determine uniqueness. Then wrap it all in a class or whatever structure they want.
908,1551142485.7141,Demetrice,So is this a viable beginning?
908,1551142621.7154,Sasha,"The concept is good, but multiplication of strings gets you an exact copy, like `'a' * 2` is `'aa'`, rather than an additional random choice. The `[0-9]` syntax isn't supported either."
908,1551142664.7157,Demetrice,Was i supposed to use () instead of []?; So i have to copy and paste? Is there a prettier solution to that?; This is where i am currently
908,1551142761.7173,Sasha,"`randint()` takes two parameters, like `randint(0, 9)`. If you do `0-9`, you're subtracting."
908,1551142813.7179,Demetrice,"Okay. I see that's goofy of me; So fixing that it looks ugly. But it'll do the first part of what we need, right?"
908,1551142881.7192,Sasha,Almost. The `random.random()` function returns a number between 0 and 1. I think you want a different function to pick from a string of possibilities.
908,1551143107.7193,Demetrice,None
908,1551143176.72,Sasha,"Cool, that looks good. (Note you have `WKYZ` at the end of the alphabet.)"
908,1551143465.7215,Carmen,"Wow, that's a first. I just went to look at the random module to see what other options there are for choice (I'm pretty sure there's a ""choose multiple times"" option), and I got a 503.; `Error 503 All backends failed or unhealthy`"
908,1551143495.7226,Demetrice,I'm trying to continue working but when i begin an if statement statement it's indenting like 8 times as much as normal. Why would that be?
908,1551143557.7233,Sasha,"Possibly an unclosed parenthesis in a previous line, so it's trying to continue that expression?"
908,1551143604.7238,Carmen,"`random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)` would help with DRY and code reuse.; Ignore `weights` and `cum_weights`, and you should be good."
909,1551143651.7252,Natosha,"Hi Guys! I have a question. I'm trying to install a new packages with pip but when I'm trying to run it. I'm getting this error
```
Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: *******\\envs\\data_analysis\\lib\\site-packages\\python_dateutil-2.7.5.dist-info\\METADATA'
```
Any reason why I'm getting that error?"
908,1551143671.7255,Natosha,And how do I fix that?
908,1551143721.7261,Demetrice,You might have to update your environment variables in settings
908,1551143748.7268,Carmen,"Alternately, you might need to reinstall `python_dateutil`"
908,1551143759.727,Natosha,"and to add, it says
```
No metadata found
```"
908,1551143776.7271,Demetrice,"So i'm now here. Truth be told i'm really bad at writing classes. And i know the syntax is probably all kinds of wrong, but are we heading in the right direction?"
908,1551143858.7281,Natosha,I tried to reinstall python_dateutil earlier but still I can't; <@Demetrice> which env variables that I need to update?
908,1551143981.7294,Carmen,"<@Demetrice> I would refactor that name generation into a class method, for clarity and less code duplication."
908,1551144030.7305,Candra,`pip install --upgrade python_dateutil` should update it
908,1551144038.7307,Carmen,"Otherwise, that looks like a solid start, assuming it's generating names appropriately.; Did you intend to have the names generation inside the __init__ constructor, or was it supposed to be outside the class?"
908,1551144168.7326,Candra,"self.name == name is an equivalence check, not an assignment, just FYI"
908,1551144262.7336,Demetrice,Right it was only supposed one question mark. I think the meet the criteria for the test i want to have it inside the constructor
908,1551144275.7342,Natosha,<@Candra> still no luck
908,1551144288.7348,Demetrice,The default name is supposed to be what's assigned to the robot from the assembly line. So i don't think it's supposed to be something that happens when i call a method; I think it's supposed to be an attribute
908,1551144312.7355,Natosha,It affects the whole pip thing not just the ```python_dateutil```; It looks like a metadata is missing; so it can't proceed
908,1551144369.7366,Candra,<@Natosha> in bash do `pip freeze | grep python_dateutil` and tell me what version it says
908,1551144402.737,Natosha,<@Candra> I'm using windows
908,1551144414.7374,Candra,Do you have git bash for windows; or just do pip freeze; and look for the package
908,1551144434.7382,Natosha,yeah I do have ubuntu subsystem; but the env that I created is in windows
908,1551144447.7389,Candra,well just do pip freeze and find the package name and version
908,1551144459.7392,Natosha,it's 2.7.5
908,1551144493.7399,Candra,do `pip uninstall python_dateutil` and then `pip install python_dateutil==2.8.0`
908,1551144545.7402,Natosha,when I tried to uninstall the package
908,1551144552.7406,Demetrice,I need to make sure the global d_names updates. Is the return statement necessary?
908,1551144554.7409,Natosha,I'm getting the exception error
908,1551144564.7411,Candra,What is the exception; Copy what it says into here
908,1551144632.7419,Natosha,"this are the last line

908,1551144701.7426,Candra,Oh wait do `pip install python-dateutil -U`
908,1551144725.7432,Sasha,"<@Demetrice> No, the `return` isn't necessary."
908,1551144804.7439,Natosha,<@Candra> still has an error
908,1551144813.7444,Demetrice,Okay nice. So i now have a class named robot and each instance of it is going to generate a new default name in the format the test wants
908,1551144815.7446,Natosha,I tried creating a new virtualenv; and install new packages and it works fine; I guess the virtualenv is destroyed
908,1551144843.7459,Candra,Yeah was gonna say just recreate it
908,1551144849.7461,Natosha,yeah hahaha
908,1551144858.7464,Candra,That's what they're there for :slightly_smiling_face:
908,1551144867.7466,Natosha,"just have to replicate the packages that I installed; hahah, do you know how to remove an existing virtualenv?"
908,1551144990.748,Demetrice,I think i just don't know how to interpret the second set of instructions. So for the second half after i call the reset method it wants it to be a new name; But not follow any pattern?
908,1551145187.7495,Corey,"I'm a newb, seems the while statement would fail with the first iteration. Is that correct?"
908,1551145482.7504,Demetrice,Oh don't sorry. I'm really new too. yet  somehow i wanna be job ready in a few weeks; The while statement is only there to make sure that the value that's randomly generated is unique
908,1551145509.7514,Corey,Did you try .appending the default_name to the d_names list initially?
908,1551145519.7516,Demetrice,So while it's not unique i want the program to try again
908,1551145564.7523,Natosha,<@Candra> I got it. Thanks man for the help :slightly_smiling_face:; <@Demetrice> sorry for interrupting your convo earlier
908,1551145676.7532,Demetrice,Oh no you're fine. I felt bad. That's why i tried to not type as much while you where going; I can understand how frustrating issues like that can be
908,1551145804.754,Corey,"<@Demetrice>     letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

    d_names = []

    default_name = random.choice(letters) + random.choice(letters) + str(random.randint(0,9))+ str(random.randint(0,9))+ str(random.randint(0,9))

    d_names.append(default_name)

    print(d_names); <@Demetrice> See the list chained to the built-in append() function? :slightly_smiling_face:"
908,1551145875.7553,Demetrice,Well so i'm writing this all as part of a class. so i don't really want to print anything
908,1551145894.7558,Corey,"Oh, the print was just a test of the desired value; It's just part of your total script from before."
908,1551145937.7568,Demetrice,"I get what you're saying. You're just saying that i should write the last line a little differently; I guess it would look better that way, Thanks"
908,1551145977.7577,Corey,The first four initialize the list.; How many elements would you like to store in the list?
908,1551146194.7592,Demetrice,It's not a fixed number. It's just supposed to pass this test; Have you ever gone through the tests on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>? They've all been pretty difficult for me so far
908,1551146219.7602,Corey,"<@Demetrice> Enclose my line 4, the one employing the .append() function, in a loop to keep adding new values to your list.; Haven't noodled around on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>; In general though, I'd offer that in your initial code snippet above, an initial value nor subsequent values were not added to the list."
910,1551148095.7635,Philip,"Given the dataset `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Mary'}]` what's the best approach to get the name of the id whose value is `n`? I can iterate through the list or do `filter`, but I'm not sure if there's a faster way of doing this when handling json."
910,1551148295.7652,Sasha,"If you're going to be doing the same operation repeatedly, it's probably worth it to build an index dict. But for a one-off, you don't have much choice but to scan through the entries one way or another, yeah."
910,1551148367.7662,Philip,"yes, the action would be done repeatedly. So I should just do `the_index = {i['id']: i for i in foo}` then `the_index.get(n)` right?"
910,1551148451.7674,Sasha,"Yep, that's what I meant. Nice!"
910,1551148458.7675,Philip,"Thanks for clarifying <@Sasha>, I was overthinking it too much like I'm missing out on something. :taco:"
911,1551155157.7683,Demetrice,Hey thanks again for all the help you guys. See you all tomorrow

913,1551157965.7722,Chuck,"What would people in here recommend for simple file logging for a transaction processing app? My app automates transactions through a windows desktop application and I want to capture logs such as:

913,1551159051.7758,Krista,"<@Chuck> It's fairly robust, and is more than adequate for the rather simple example logs you provided. You are handed FileHandlers out of the box, and can even setup automatic file log rotation.

913,1551159198.7771,Chuck,"interesting, worth investigating -- I don't need rotating log files, I need log files 'attached' (by using the same filename aside from the "".log"" extension) to the batch files that are processed.

920,1551194495.8091,Jonas,Your password is being passed in wrong.; Debug why. Print `repr()` of the password and ensure it's correct.; Maybe there is a newline on the end. Maybe there is an extra character.

A. This is not currently a native feature in DataTables (although it is likely to be added in future). Instead, you would need to load the JSON data using $.ajax and assign the column definition array using the columns option.

920,1551194665.8114,Nikki,I think that's only the data not the actual columns; I have that currently set but I want to create a 'report builder' where the users can select different data points so the columns would need to be dynamic rather than predefined; I'm using flask so I could do some kind of `if` statement with jinja but it feels a bit messy
920,1551194860.8142,Jorge,you could use the api to hide/show columns after you received your json data. although that could be kind of messy depending on how you implement it
920,1551194934.8146,Nikki,Yea not sure - shame you can't just define them in the JSON; My js skills are not very good; as in I have no js skills lol
920,1551195033.8162,Jorge,"i havent tried this in datatables, but you could wait to create the datatables object itself until you actually select your fields/receive your json; you'd also probably need to create the associated html at that time too"

921,1551196720.8247,Carmen,<@Annalee> you're looking for the SMTPLib. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtp-example>
921,1551196728.8248,Jimmy,There are probably lots of people that don't have a unique name. I don't think that will wor'mk
921,1551196764.8258,Carmen,"Since you have to construct the entire message before sending it, you'll have all of the message available in your script to be saved wherever you want it to be."
921,1551196836.8269,Annalee,<@Carmen> Thank you for your reply. I am able to send email. But the requirement is I need to save the mail sent in say pdf format or .msg format along with the attachments sent in the mail
921,1551196858.8272,Hiroko,what happens if attachment is a zip file?
921,1551196948.8287,Annalee,"<@Hiroko> Good question, unfortunately i am not able to find a solution for that.
Basically I am stuck saving a single file, If we are able to do with single file, then we can think of zip"
921,1551197084.8298,Carmen,"You're not going to easily be able to save a message in .msg format, since that's a proprietary binary format. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html#module-mailbox> is probably a good bet for giving you the ability to save messages on-disk in a standard fashion.; Being perfectly honest, this is a solved problem in-general. You want a mailbox to store messages in. Once you have it there, you can open it and manipulate it using any number of additional tools.; I'd recommend mbox, since that's an open *nix standard, but you can choose whatever works best for you."
921,1551197337.8329,Annalee,"<@Carmen> Thank you. I will explore mailbox.
There is one problem If I am not wrong mails sent via SMTP are not stored in sent. So using mailbox will not solve this problem"
921,1551197460.8333,Carmen,"Correct. You will need to save the messages before or after sending.; I'd be willing to bet there's a tool already in-place that lets you send messages directly from an mbox mailbox, so you'd be able to save the email to disk and then make a library call to send the message from the mbox mailbox."
921,1551197566.8355,Annalee,"That is what i am trying to do, saving the message locally in some format, so i can re use the mail sent for further steps; I can try out this"
921,1551197639.8359,Carmen,"<https://gist.github.com/wojdyr/1176398>; This gist will send everything in an mbox mailbox. All you'd need to do is modify it to send the last item in the mailbox, and then just call it after you've saved the message to the mailbox."

925,1551204133.8446,Carlo,"your question is of really large scope, where are you stuck, what have you tried?"
925,1551204284.8448,Hilma,actually i am new to python!! i have tried different method but they all are not substantial!! I know it's large but if you would just divide it in small parts which would be easy for me to solve?
925,1551204340.845,Carmen,Part of learning to develop software is learning the soft skills required to take a large task specification like this and break it into small enough components that you can work on yourself.
925,1551204482.8452,Hilma,yeah exactly i am trying it!! but i am not able to break it or understand it i don't know!! i am just feeling as if i am not fit for learning python may be!!
925,1551204700.8454,Sasha,"I'd say the first step is to figure out your algorithm, just as pencil-and-paper steps. Forget about Python, but make sure you know how the problem is supposed to be solved at all.; That said, this is a bad task for learning Python... I'd start with something much simpler if you're fresh to the language."
925,1551205221.8458,Hilma,i know but i have done the basic syntax and all of python!!Then i joined a competetion for python where they gave us this question!! everyone else was able to solve this except me!!!!!! i though and tried to solve it many times but i don't why i am not able to solve it!! if you would just provide me the direction and divide it in small part then i think it will easy for me solve it
926,1551205576.8461,Sasha,"Well, like I said, the first step is to figure out your algorithm in general, independently of the code. Understand how the examples arrive at their answers in a way you can describe."
925,1551205578.8463,Carlo,"as <@Sasha> said, forget about Python, think of it purely logically; take an easy shape, and go one step at a time

- what's your problem?
- what is the desired outcome?
- what do you already know?
- what do you need to know?"
925,1551205755.8468,Hilma,outer number present in matrix is to be removed first then i guess the inner matrix should be check one by one if it is less then or greater then outer matrix !!! is it right?
925,1551205841.847,Sasha,"You may want to start without considering the case of the depth-0 holes, since that seems to require a different sort of analysis than the regular pools."
925,1551205879.8472,Hilma,what is the regular one?
925,1551205899.8474,Sasha,"The regular ones that retain water, I mean."
925,1551206019.8476,Hilma,<@Carlo> can you divide the whole problem into small parts ?

928,1551212081.8602,Nikki,Yea I added the content of id_rsa.pub into github; so how do I do `git pull origin master`

928,1551212193.8627,Carmen,"Then, assuming you've added the remote to your repo as `origin`, you should be able to `git pull origin` and so on."
928,1551212230.8631,Nikki,is that the part I'm missing added the report to repo; How might I do that; (seems like eveytime I think I'm getting 'good' someone schools me lol)
928,1551212284.8641,Carmen,`git remote` will show all of your remotes for the repo.; You should have one listed as `origin`; `git remote show origin` will give you the details of how it's configured.

So i have to try a roll back to 2.1?"
934,1551274130.9148,Hiroko,no worries!; I would roll back
934,1551274140.9154,Valeri,<@Hiroko> `<http://localhost:9200/arxivdb/_search?pretty=true&amp;q=*:*>`; That's basically a select all on ES
934,1551274155.916,Hiroko,"and FYI, when using third party libs, check the documentation on their requirements; you’ll see what versions are supported"
934,1551274179.9164,Valeri,None; A subset of the data that I see
934,1551274200.9172,Hiroko,"gotcha, interesting; and a headache; what version ES are you using?"
934,1551274262.9182,Valeri,`6.6.1`; The latest I guess

934,1551274987.9206,Hilma,<@Carmen> thnx for the advice but as i have told i don't want you to do my work just guide or tell me how to think for these kind of problem!! I have the ability to do my own work but just as an advice or guidence i ask this question at this channel as this channel name is HELP!!
935,1551275051.9208,Hilma,<@Mariah> this is a competition question!
934,1551275369.9216,Jennefer,"<@Hiroko> Thank you so much, you saved me:hugging_face:"
934,1551275440.9218,Hiroko,"glad to help :slightly_smiling_face:; I’m curious, how did you install that version?"
936,1551275800.9229,Cheri,Hi! Does anyone have experience with running Python scripts within JavaScript. I am trying to implement some cryptography and I’ve read that CryptoJS is terrible
936,1551275849.9235,Clemmie,Do you want a user to interact with the web/JS and then do crypto stuff in python?
934,1551275897.925,Cheri,"Yes, so essentially say I want to encrypt some data that came from a form in React. I want to encrypt it in Python (because of the implementation of what I’m working with is in Python); So I literally have to run some functions at different stages"
934,1551275944.9261,Clemmie,if so you will want to take a look at one of the python web frameworks for handling AJAX events and running the crypto algos you want. Take a look at any of django/flask/pyramid; Think carefully about what you are trying to do - the data will travel over the wire in plaintext
934,1551275982.9271,Cheri,Yes I have looked at that; and it is not a solution that makes sense even when sending information over TLS
934,1551276013.9287,Jennefer,"<@Hiroko> I've followed that guide:
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release>"
934,1551276016.929,Cheri,I have to perform the encryption and re-encryption locally as I do not want the private key t o leave the system.
934,1551276035.9295,Clemmie,"when you mean locally, you mean on the server or the client?"
934,1551276035.9296,Cheri,Also I have the stack done in JS already so I don’t want to re=do it; Client
934,1551276057.9304,Clemmie,"So, short of building a native app in python, you don’t have any options; If you want it to work in-browser, it is js or nothing"
934,1551276090.9313,Cheri,"Essentially I input some data say my phone number, I want to input that into a python function locally and get the output then send that output over the network"
934,1551276109.9316,Clemmie,You need a native python app for that
934,1551276146.932,Cheri,Fair enough!; Well thanks anyways!
934,1551276527.9347,Coleen,How can I import a module from a modules directory which is not a subdir of my source dir?
934,1551276622.9359,Ashley,<@Cheri> typically you would rely on the existing layers of encryption provided by things like HTTPS when you post form data to the server
934,1551276659.9383,Cheri,Yeah I was thinking of implementing TLS but that would still mean I have to send Alice’s private key over the network and the plaintext and that is too risky.
934,1551276671.9387,Coleen,"ie, my python file is in `/files/src/file.py` and it contains `from modules import mymod.py`. The module is in `/files/modules/mymod.py`."
934,1551276690.9393,Ashley,"Look into public key cryptography. If it didn't work, we wouldn't use it"
934,1551276719.9406,Coleen,I created `modules/__init__.py` but that doesn't seem to help.
934,1551276742.9416,Ashley,"The technology is already there when using HTTPS, so you don't need to worry about it"
934,1551276758.9424,Clemmie,"<@Ashley> I think <@Cheri> is - he wants to encrypt with the client user’s private key ultimately, and is right to not want to send that over the wire"
934,1551276767.9427,Cheri,I am using a very specific type of public key cryptography called Proxy Re-Encryption that’s why I need the functionality in the client side; Exactly
934,1551277012.9482,Ashley,"<@Coleen> you want to make a ""package"" that you can ""install"" into your python environment. You've got the right idea with `__init__.py`, but make sure your package structure makes sense. You can even make multiple packages if you like. The ""install"" basically puts a copy of the package into the python's `site-packages` folder, which is where it looks for third-party packages when you try to import them.

Just a heads up, though. When you make a virtual environment, you're making a new copy of python that has its own `site-packages` folder. But that's a good thing."
934,1551277073.9485,Coleen,"I am using a conda environment already, because I have some external dependencies."
934,1551277201.9502,Ashley,"<@Coleen> conda can manage environments. But you should still make a package that can be installed, and then have conda install it to the environment it's managing for you"
934,1551277237.9513,Coleen,"I see, so the idea is to install my package into the same conda env?"
937,1551277251.9516,Coleen,"But how can I ""make"" the package?"
934,1551277291.9523,Ashley,"I'm unfamiliar with proxy re-encryption, so I won't be much help then :joy:"
934,1551277422.9544,Cheri,"Hahhaha no worries, essentially I just have to run some python code in a JS app; I’ll figure it out somehow! I’m sure someone else has had the same issue at some point!; hehehe thakns for the input tho!!\"
934,1551277532.9578,Ashley,"<@Coleen> you can make a ""package"" by having a folder with an `__init__.py` module in it and (usually) other python modules and packages as well. You can make it installable with `setuptool` and a `setup.py` file (this isn't usually inside your package, but is still bundled in the project's folder along with the package). A quick Google search should bring up a simple guide on how to make a `setup.py` file with `setuptools`"
934,1551277600.9581,Coleen,"Awesome, thanks <@Ashley>!"
934,1551277775.9582,Ashley,No problem! Good luck!
934,1551278686.96,Chelsey,"I need to write some scripts but the machine they will run on only has python 2.6.6, and there's sadly no possibilty of getting 3.anything. They'll be fairly simple stuff, mostly string manipulation and spitting out .csv files for load elsewhere. Do I care about the version really, or is there anything I should know? I've not used 2.* at all to date - everything I have done has been python3."
938,1551278797.9605,Karoline,is there a possibility of at least getting 2.7.x?
939,1551280508.9606,Carmen,"There have been multiple ways people have suggested how you should think about the problem to move towards a solution.

""the first step is to figure out your algorithm, just as pencil-and-paper steps. Forget about Python, but make sure you know how the problem is supposed to be solved at all.""
""take an easy shape, and go one step at a time

- what's your problem?
- what is the desired outcome?
- what do you already know?
- what do you need to know?""

You haven't showed us anything about what you've already tried, what parts you don't understand, any of the usual things that we need to help someone figure out their problems. Instead, you've been asking us to break it into small parts *for* you. We're more than happy to help solve specific problems you might have, but breaking up the overall problem into smaller tasks is part of the work of solving the problem. You have to be able to break things up into smaller tasks by yourself as part of programming. If you can't seem to do that for this problem, then you need to find a different problem. It's not that you're not cut out for Python or programming, you're just trying to solve a problem that's beyond your current skills, and you should find a different, easier problem to cut your teeth on and build up the mental skills you need to break up a large problem like this into smaller tasks.; It might be worth looking into compiling it all into a single executable. You could sneak in 3.x in there that way, if that's a possibility."
939,1551282668.9615,Alvina,None; TypeError: can't pickle _thread.RLock objects; I believe I am getting this error because I am referencing a function in my loop - it works fine when outside of a class; process_chunk is a separate function within the same class - any idea how I can reference it?

939,1551282775.964,Alvina,Airflow operator; but I first made the functions in a normal Python script / jupyter notebook to test it
939,1551282805.9649,Melynda,"Ah, multiprocessing, I assume is what `mp` is?"
939,1551282810.9652,Alvina,yes; sorry; I added more lines of the code for clarity; None; process_chunk is a function which is just sending compressed CSV files to a REST API
939,1551282870.967,Melynda,"&gt; Note When an object is put on a queue, the object is pickled and a background thread later flushes the pickled data to an underlying pipe. This has some consequences which are a little surprising, but should not cause any practical difficulties – if they really bother you then you can instead use a queue created with a manager.

939,1551283496.9699,Melynda,"I think you need to make your iterable (job_zip) pickle-able, which it isn't at the minute since it's a bunch of itertools callables?"
939,1551283657.9704,Alvina,"moving the function outside of the class and then adding self.process_chunk = process_chunk to __init__ worked; yeah - should I replace the job_zip? I can add a += count, and the hook, token, stream_id, and execution_id are all static; None; then chunks is just the output of that function which reads a big csv file and compresses it into 50-100MB chunks before sending it"
939,1551284029.974,Melynda,"Here's what I was testing: <https://gist.github.com/d17e36c1674238725a8e9b06ef955c43>
I don't think having the called method in a class in inherently _wrong_, but the iterable (and possibly all locals within the pool call?) must be pickleable.; Weird, my indentation has gone mental in that gist; In the `Incorrect` class, the iterable `job` is a bunch of functions, which can't be serialized. In the `Correct` class, it's just a bunch of strings that are processed by process_chunk. Make sense?; Pass data into the pool, not functions or methods, and you should be fine. :slightly_smiling_face:"
939,1551284185.9763,Alvina,"wow, your example looks much nicer than my actual code haha. thanks a bunch; yeah, I will test some changes"

939,1551284427.9774,Candra,"Upon an exception using `requests` module, does the function always return `None` to the object?"

```"
940,1551284762.9803,Hiroko,functions/methods always return None by default
939,1551284776.9807,Hiroko,"so if you’re not returning anything explicitly, the return type is `None`"
939,1551284786.9808,Sasha,"I would expect that `r` would remain undefined if an exception is thrown, since the interpreter jumps out of the `get()` call prematurely."
939,1551285048.9811,Demetrice,So i think the problem is my final while loop. I was able to test that words.split() creates a list for me. But i was wanting to do was add the first character of each of those list entries to result. However it's still returning everything
939,1551285184.9822,Sasha,"The trouble is that your `for y in x` loop is completely inside your `while` loop, so it goes through the whole word before the `while` has a chance to stop it."
939,1551285219.9828,Lillia,Misread whoops
939,1551285257.9836,Sasha,"A handy trick is that strings are addressable like lists, so `str[i]` is the `i`th character."
939,1551285305.9842,Demetrice,"Right right so if i'm looking for the first character all i have to do is ask it to return str[0], right?"
939,1551285314.9844,Sasha,Bingo.
940,1551285435.9845,Demetrice,"There we go, I think this is what i was looking for. Thank You. :taco: <@Sasha>"
939,1551286361.9854,Demetrice,"So i had to change it to this because it was failing cases where the word started with not a letter. But now it's failing cases where there's a  hyphenated word like metal-oxide cause it'll miss the ""o"" I know i could iterate the whole string looking for the '-' but i'm not sure what i'd do after that. Is there a more beautiful solution?"
939,1551286546.9865,Lillia,You may want to look into using <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha>
939,1551286565.9869,Carlo,"<@Demetrice> you could remove non-letter characters, I guess?"
939,1551286589.9876,Lillia,Just so you don't have to keep having the list of letters

939,1551286841.9915,Demetrice,Thanks! I was able to clean it up a bit with that. I thought there must have been a better way. So now my core code looks better. But i still need to think of a solution to that problem
939,1551287243.9921,Lillia,"If I were you, I'd break this down into two parts: getting the list of words (without symbols), and appending the first letters.

939,1551287285.9926,Demetrice,"Here i'll put it back in the main chat. I thought i had something but i might be on the wrong train of thought again; So now python is telling me it has an issue with the way i'm using isalpha. But i just tested that. I think it's issue is with something else i did. What i was thinking was i would replace the ""-"" with a white space then try to re-split it. That may not be ideal; the x.replace on line 7 should be x.split"
939,1551287474.9936,Lillia,Do your replacement before anything else; Because you are trying to split on those spaces; :thumbsup_all:

939,1551287653.9956,Demetrice,Honestly i didn't even see that. It went up top for some reason. I'm looking at it now. It looks so much simpler than mine; You did it in one line of code. :anguished::upside_down_face: what does the [^\w] mean?  How does it know how to look for words like that?
939,1551287937.997,Lillia,"It's ""word character"" in regex, it'll split on anything that isn't alphanum or underscore"

939,1551288127.0002,Lillia,"This looks like it will replace <http://regex101.com|regex101.com> for me, thanks!; Do you still need `if y[0].isalpha():` if you've removed the hyphens?"
939,1551288210.0008,Sasha,"I think `replace()` returns a modified copy of the string, rather than changing the original."

939,1551288793.0042,Lillia,You shouldn't have to reference `y[1]` anywhere anymore; All your words will be alpha numeric only now
939,1551288831.0046,Demetrice,"Yeah okay then some of this code is redundant hang on; Well i think i need it for this test case specifically. Because otherwise it'll return a blank space for the 3rd word ""The Road _Not_ Taken""; ""The Road _Not_ Taken""; The not is nested in underscores"

If you just want to skip non-matching chars then use `pairs.get(x, '')` - that will return the empty string as a default when the lookup fails; if you want it to fails, or return an empty string, or some other functionality when there is a mismatch, use a try except clause; None"

942,1551295043.0156,Clemmie,"<@Phebe> Can you be a little more specific? The question how many photos are in an image file is hard to understand. By definition it is one - unless you want to do something much deeper like edge detection to separate out several photos that were, say, scanned into a single file"
942,1551295120.016,Sasha,Looks like TIFF files are a little weird in that they can contain multiple pages.
942,1551295133.0163,Clemmie,Really? ok then
942,1551295172.0167,Phebe,this is tif file is a file that contains several photos
942,1551295198.0173,Clemmie,"I guess then <@Phebe>, you are looking for someone who understands the tif format definition"

942,1551295627.0192,Sasha,"That shouldn't be a problem... image APIs can usually deal with that, and if they need a file-like object, you can wrap the bytes in a `StringIO`."

942,1551299762.0279,Coleen,yes i realized it actually does what i want
942,1551299767.0281,Clemmie,"Oh, perfect1"
942,1551299778.0286,Coleen,its just that in my code the iterator was empty; so the last print was failing; loop was still fine though
942,1551299874.0298,Lillia,Yeah that's a bit dangerous since `val` will be undefined; may be safer to have a default for if it's empty.
942,1551299905.03,Coleen,yup; or an assert len(iterator)
942,1551300110.0306,Clemmie,Don’t use the assert; It is possible to skip asserts with command line flags; In this case not the worst thing. But I have seen code where asserts were used to control flow logic and would have blown up catastrophically
942,1551300402.0319,Coleen,Good point.
945,1551302179.0324,Coleen,What should I do if I need to loop through the same iterator twice?
945,1551302228.0328,Lillia,How long of an iterator?; A list seems reasonable.
945,1551302279.0332,Coleen,&lt; 10 elements
945,1551302669.0337,Clemmie,Is it possible to do both things you need to do in one loop?
945,1551302998.0341,Coleen,"Actually, yes, I found a way to so do :slightly_smiling_face:; But if it wasn't?"
945,1551303036.0348,Clemmie,"You can loop through twice, use 2 for loops; just know that it will be less performant"
946,1551304087.0353,Chelsey,"Probably not, would it make a big difference?; You mean with something like pyinstaller?"
946,1551305024.0368,Karoline,Yeah there are a lot of automated tools for conversion between the two as well as from future imports. 
946,1551305143.037,Carmen,"Yes. If you just need a deployable black-box solution that does the thing, just use PyInstaller and document the hell out of the build process."
945,1551308224.0389,Jennifer,"I'm trying to write a script to generate a config file.

The intended usage is:

./genconfig.py 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.03

```
Generates config file using the values above plus some other stuff
```

or

./genconfig.py --discovery 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.1

```
Conects to above ips and do discovery. It will get the list of ips from the clusters to which the ips belong
```


Code:
```
    argp = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=""Generate configuration for prometheus"")
    group = argp.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
    
    group.add_argument('servers', help=""List of nodes to configure, separated by space"", nargs='*', type=str, metavar='node_ip')
    group.add_argument('--discovery', nargs='*', help='Node(s) to connect to and do discovery')
```

So I want them to be mutually exclusive but at least one or the other is required.

I get the error:

```

```; Does this mean I can't have the positional argument as mutually exclusive with an optional?"
945,1551308603.0403,Lillia,Does the second one still generate a config?; With `--discovery`
945,1551308643.0414,Jennifer,Yes. It just generates the config from the values discovered from the remote server as opposed to list passed as positional args.
945,1551308677.042,Lillia,I'd consider making `discovery` just a store_true argument; Then you have `if discovery: .... else: ....`
945,1551308742.0434,Jennifer,I will definitely try that. But I am still wondering if I can't use the positional as mutually exclusive.
945,1551308742.0435,Lillia,"Because the list of IPs exists for both, right?"
945,1551308750.0437,Jennifer,Correct.
945,1551308792.0442,Lillia,Yeah I'd think you should be able to do that if `required=True` exists for the `add` call
945,1551308895.0448,Jennifer,"I was using `nargs='+'` but I thought that just changing to `nargs='*'` would make it ""optional"".; Thanks a lot, <@Lillia>"

947,1551331838.0018,Sasha,"I'm not an expert, but I tend to agree with your assessment. They are using a context manager with the cursor, but not the connection. The minimal change would probably be passing a key to `getconn()`, so the second invocation of the function reuses the same connection."

971,1551442266.185,Karoline,you'll probably need to mock `input`
970,1551442305.1858,Karoline,there's not really a way to have input happen during a test without it
970,1551442312.186,Jamey,I thought just importing the function would work. The input is outside the function.; So the tests should (in theory) just work; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
970,1551442358.1869,Karoline,is `input` inside another function or global to the module (minor_elder_youth.py)?
970,1551442430.1873,Jamey,"It is global; Here's the module; Initially I'd put the `input` and `datetime.strptime` stuff at the top but I thought that could be why the test is failing, so I tried moving it lower down to see if that would work."
970,1551442565.1895,Karoline,"yeah so when you import the module, that input fires"
970,1551442566.1898,Jimmy,there might be a way to mock stdin with pytest; with something like `expect`
970,1551442577.1903,Jamey,And here's the test module for completeness
970,1551442608.1915,Karoline,"you'll want to move the input to something like:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    year = input('blah blah')
```"
970,1551442612.1919,Jamey,Hmmm... Is there a way to avoid that? <@Karoline>; Oh seen your response. My bad :sweat_smile:
970,1551442635.1929,Karoline,that sort of thing - so that way it only executes that code when the module is run as the main entry point of a program
970,1551442677.1936,Jamey,Okay cool. Thanks for that. `mock` seemed a bit _much_ for what I'm doing here. Thanks <@Karoline> :taco:
970,1551442701.194,Karoline,"yeah I think changing the structure will improve the layout of things anyway, so it's good to do."
970,1551443422.1949,Jamey,How do I get only the year in a datetime object so that I can use it in subtraction?
972,1551443838.1968,Hiroko,"```In [2]: dt = datetime.now()

In [3]: dt.year
Out[3]: 2019```"
972,1551443881.1975,Jimmy,afaik you should use `timedelta` when subtracting with `datetime`
972,1551444017.1981,Hiroko,yep
970,1551444040.1987,Hiroko,but also <@Jamey> check the docs for what is available for a datetime object :slightly_smiling_face:

which beautiful soup version will be used when i do ``` import bs4 ``` if both 4.6.0 and 4.7.1 are installed"
974,1551450715.2102,Carmen,"<@Alvina> There is no hard limit to how many processes you can have in a pool, or even how many pools you can have (though you should probably re-evaluate whether you need more than one or two pools at all).; The effective limit is how many processes it takes before context switching between them starts to degrade performance more than the multiprocessing enhances performance.; That's 100% dependent on your workflow and the tasks you're running (CPU bound, IO bound, memory bound, etc.).; A good rule of thumb to start out is number of cores * 4."
974,1551450845.2128,Jimmy,<@Carissa> you can't have both installed for the same python environment; so the answer is the one installed for that environment
974,1551450996.2156,Alvina,"<@Carmen> okay cool. thanks. yeah - there are clear performance gains up to a certain point as I tweak the number of processes and the size of the files I am compressing, i guess I will just play around and monitor it"
974,1551451032.2163,Carissa,no <@Jimmy> i am creating one enviornment where i have downloaded .tar file of beautiful soup and then i call one script which append both versions path in ```sys.path``` and then after i call ``` import bs4 ```; my all functionality works fine but i have doubt which version is used
974,1551451125.2177,Jimmy,AFAIK it scan the syspath in order; so the first you append to the sys.path; there might be a way to access the bs4 version in code to you are sure
974,1551451558.2187,Jonas,"```In [1]: import bs4

979,1551480733.228,Letty,"Tough to say, if you’re doing `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` or similar, then anything might be pulling in the dependency.

`pipenv` handles this well, you may be able to do (just once, no need to switch) `pipenv -r ./requirements.txt` and then use `pipenv graph --reverse` to see who pulled it in.; alternatively, install your requirements.txt one at a time, by hand, and see when `pathlib` is installed by looking for that pahtlib egg directory."

1018,1551716451.411,Mica,i currently have the following for an Elasticsearch query class and two files worth of queries. I want to be able to have the queries being part of the instantiated class if possible without moving all of the query functions into the class itself? Is there a way to do this with some kind of inheritance? Let me know if anything is unclear thanks!; the two files are queries specific to independent ES indexes
1018,1551716627.412,Lillia,I'm confused by ```I want to be able to have the queries being part of the instantiated class if possible without moving all of the query functions into the class itself?``` do these query functions already exist?; Or is `first_query()` an example of one?
1018,1551716788.4149,Mica,"just an example and they do exist. I have one file that has the class defined with all the key components such as IP and port, and I've recently added the ability to parse indexes and doc_type to the class. I have to files containing queries for the ES using this Model, originally each query instantiated a new class instance and used that for the query. I was wondering if it would be possible to get around that by making the queries a part of the class without copy pasting them into the actual class code and making it some several hundred line file; so:
```
class Foo:
  ...

def query():
  Foo().query()
```

1018,1551716941.4175,Clemmie,"I would say don’t compromise clarity and readability for some amorphous idea that the file is “too long” if the queries are cognitively tied to the class, then make them part of it"

1018,1551717024.4202,Clemmie,"If they are not, then you probably want something where the class sets up the connections and workflow, and then fires a query. You could have a method

   def run(query_function):

```"

1018,1551717128.4232,Lillia,"FWIW you can also go the other way around, where you pass the `Foo` object into the query function. Think of how you pass a database engine/connection to some frameworks."

1018,1551717211.4251,Clemmie,"^great suggestion if you have queries that can be run by different backends; Not a decorator, because you want it to be dynamic; you have an abstract class SearchClass; that defines an abstract method `run`; you implement `run` for however individual backends run their query type; then your queries take a `klass` parameter and do this

1022,1551727588.4661,Dominga,"Hi,

I’ve been having some issues with class attributes and properties (python 3). I know how getters and setters are generally used and that it’s the pythonic way to use the `@property` to achieve define getters and setters when they are required.

Any feedback is appreciated. Sorry for the longish quesiton.

Now my question is twofold:

Part 1
How and why should I define the attribute:
```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        # or instead 
        self._name = name
        # which is preferred and why?

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name
```

Part 2
With the `@property` decorator, I can add some logic to setting an attribute after the fact. So if it has been publicly set like: `instance.attribute = some_value`, I can use a property to route this through a setter and check the if, for example, `some_value` is in a specific range.

This makes sense to me. However, what if want to use a setter as defined above, but indicate to the user that it is not part of the public API of the class?

For example, if I don’t want client code to use a specific attribute, I’d write `self._attribute`. How would I do this with property decorator?"
1021,1551727710.4672,Lillia,Why do you want to use a setter but hide it?
1021,1551727720.4673,Clemmie,"so, first of all the `_` is convention, nothing _stops_ client code from using it. That aside, you can use the property assignment instead of the decorator; This is what you would do - it is not an accepted answer, but it is correct <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42137210/python-property-with-public-getter-and-private-setter>"
1021,1551728117.4704,Dominga,"thank you <@Clemmie>, I’ll have a look at that link

<@Lillia> I thought that it could be used to validate the data for the attribute when set internally by my class. Would such a validation be unnecessary if the attribute is set internally by the class?"
1021,1551728136.4707,Lillia,"Can't you do the validation in the method that's setting the new value?; Getters/setters make the life of the caller easier, that's really it.; Makes for less typing.; I wouldn't add unnecessary boilerplate if you're already setting the value yourself.; (I'll add a caveat, a setter _may_ be good if you use this validation in many places); Actually I take that back; using a setter for validation is a bit weird."
1021,1551728432.4771,Clemmie,"Validation on attribute change is a hard one. The client can still access the underlying attribute without calling the setter. It is kind of like front-end back-end validation. Good to do on the frontend for speed/clarity, but if you don’t check on the backend also you will compromised; So, by all means validate on change, but you should also when the value is _used_"
1022,1551728461.4782,Dominga,"Hm, I thought it is more readable and contained in that class.

I have an instance of an Account class, modeling a bank account. For that bank account, I have a balance attribute and a corresponding setter, that checks if it ever drops below 0. If it does, it raises a ValueError.

I also have an Atm class which uses the account object and calls `account.withdraw(amount)` or `account.deposit(amount)`.

To me it seemed useful to have that ‘data integrity’ check inside the setter of the balance."
1021,1551728509.479,Lillia,I would have `withdraw()` do the check. Adding a setter simply for validation is unneeded boilerplate. It doesn't make the life of the caller any easier.
1022,1551728605.4816,Dominga,So what is a setter for if not for validation of the to be set value?
1021,1551728620.482,Lillia,"<https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1551728154471100>; For example, following your account example, you may want to do validation when a caller sets the actual account balance.; Rather than having `account.setBalance(x)`, you can define a setter and simply do `account.balance = x`"

*THANKS*"
1021,1551728693.4845,Lillia,"Your setter can do the same validation that `setBalance` would have done, but it makes the syntax cleaner for the caller. Does that make sense?; You aren't expecting the caller to directly set the balance, correct?"

1021,1551728793.4871,Clemmie,"what is the value you need to change, and is it part of a string that is unique in each file?"
1021,1551728794.4874,Dominga,"That makes sense.

That is correct. The caller would invoke the `withdraw` method of the account object, which would set the balance internally."
1021,1551728814.4881,Lillia,Right; you already have methods that the caller will use. Those methods can do the validation just fine.
1021,1551728818.4884,Dominga,"Ahhh, so if my Atm class would set the balance directly, then it would make sense to create a setter?"

1021,1551730333.5074,Clemmie,"for the future, you want to add the unix toolkit to your toolkit - `sed` `awk` `cut` `uniq` and `sort` in particular can get you through a whole host of text manipulation problems that we tend to think in much more python for; sure"

1021,1551730476.5087,Clemmie,"you would need to do the line breaks, given what I showed you, if the line breaks are in the text; but! there are other ways"
1021,1551730497.5091,Ludie,i am scared about pasting line breaks into the terminal; usually doesnt work out the way i want it to
1021,1551730524.5095,Clemmie,"you could use a json processor (there are a bunch, you can take a look for them) to flatten the file, then changeout the text, then use the processor to re-save them pretty printed; also the char `\n` is the newline indicator (usually) so you would do `{""language"": ""en"",\n""country"": ""uk""}`; and also put the `\n` in the replaced text and you would be ok"
1021,1551730580.5101,Ludie,nice!
1021,1551730582.5103,Clemmie,"that is if you wanted to deal with the file as is; just always make sure to make a backup copy before messing with it, and you will be fine; in `sed` you might need to escape control characters (link \n) but you can figure that out quickly enough"
1021,1551730652.5109,Ludie,"noted; yes, i am a little familiar with escaping characters"
1021,1551730707.5121,Alvina,is there a lot of overhead opening a file as gzip as text compared to a normal file?
1021,1551730709.5123,Ludie,s/ /g is to ground the changes ? and the start and end versions are always separated by a slash?
1021,1551730722.5127,Alvina,I am pretty much immediately writing chunks of it back to gzip to send elsewhere
1021,1551730770.5129,Clemmie,"so `s` = substitute, `/a/b/` = b for a, `g`=globally; if you leave out the g it will only replace the first occurrence in the file"

1021,1551730811.5139,Clemmie,"you can change the slash delimiter, but I don’t recall the syntax; no problem. This is fun stuff to me"

1021,1551731022.5161,Alvina,"unzipped.; so I was copying to gzip instead to be kind to the network; and then opening the gzip file; Mar 5, 2019	Scheduled update	4:16 am SGT	5m 6s	3,959,765	 Data updated successfully	 
Mar 4, 2019	Scheduled update	6:45 pm SGT	3m 16s	3,916,909	 Data updated successfully; yeah I saw about a 2 minute difference almost where the gzip version was slower - but it could be a fluke; will have to keep an eye on it"
1021,1551731097.5179,Lillia,Hmm interesting
1021,1551731106.5184,Alvina,the file is 260ish MB compressed
1021,1551731111.5186,Lillia,I would guess that the network would be the bottleneck
1021,1551731120.5192,Alvina,so the overall time should be way lower (copy from remote server to local server)
1021,1551731123.5194,Lillia,Without any actual knowledge of the situation :smile:
1021,1551731135.5198,Alvina,just the process with opening and uploading data might be slower.. will have to check
1021,1551731157.5203,Lillia,You could write a simpler tester.; I'd think the 20x smaller network call would be more than worth the cost of unzipping.
1021,1551731262.5208,Alvina,None

1021,1551731374.5242,Alvina,"yeah; I can send chunks of data to the API in parallel though, so I read from a huge csv and yield a chunk (50MBish seems to be fastest); and then upload it through the REST API; I could potentially save the file in parquet format, read it, write it in memory as csv before uploading it; not sure if it would be worth it; i have been considering moving over to a file format (like parquet) instead of using postgres just because my actual database operations are pretty limited - I don't really normalize most tables or use foreign keys. I do need to maintain unique constraints and update data though"
1021,1551731935.528,Bethany,"probably need a DB for storage, but I love parquet for transferring tabular data around. Compression is great and the io speed is good too"

I want to ping my team's MS teams chat room with the status of the run (success, fail, traceback). Is there a preferred way to do this? (monitor logs, push to SNS or SQS, directly transmit from lambda to ms teams). Keep in mind the function is also returning the results to a caller. (should the caller be the one to do this?); related note, is there like a cloud-centric architecture patterns book or something?"
1026,1551737944.5332,Lillia,Can you use an incoming webhook and just make a POST from the Lambda?; Does MS Teams have a webhook thing like Slack? (missed that part)
1026,1551738000.5337,Bethany,yea; so i have a lambda that can take a payload and forward it to ms teams; but I don't want problems with publishing to ms teams breaking my inference pipeline

1026,1551738070.5345,Bethany,oh simple enough then
1026,1551738075.5347,Lillia,Just wrap that POST in a try-catch
1026,1551751202.542,Kara,"<@Bethany> There are some, but I wouldn't count on them being too relevant for too long. Things are moving fast. I personally try to find case studies (sometimes directly within AWS learning center/docs) and go over those. They describe real-world scenarios and their solutions.

As for your Lambda question, I'd imagine (without knowing what MS chat room is), that there is an endpoint (much like on slack) that you can just send the notification to. Question is -- can you do it (assuming the Lambda is in Python) asynchronously, without blocking the rest of it? Is it even important (since the notification is possibly the last thing the Lambda does)?

If the answer is yes, I'd find MS chat root endpoint you can send your notification to (much like Slack's webhooks) and not bother with an intermediary like SNS."
1027,1551751474.5456,Kara,"*Intro*

Coming back to Python after a long hiatus, I have a couple of questions in the realm of application dependency management. It seems that it is still a mess, what with the venv, wrapper, poetry and pipenv controversy and so on...

*Questions*

1. (more general one) why, in every single folder structure recommendation, there is a redundancy in folder names? like, if I have a `my-module` module, the ""main"" code folder would be `my-module/my-module` as opposed to `my-module/lib` or `my-module/src` or some other similar, more abstract naming convention?
2. is there any sort of consensus, aside from `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` on how to separate dev. dependencies from production ones and the proper way to manage them *without going into poetry/pipenv and such*?"

1032,1551777399.577,Dominga,"Hi, any input is appreciated:

I have a class with about 15 mandatory data fields. I want the caller to instantiate an object from this class, using a classmethod, which reads and parses an excel file (e.g., `instance.from_excel(filepath)`).

I don’t want the user to construct it like `obj = MyClass(15_different_args)`, since that would be quite tedious and the data can only be extracted from an excel file anyways. Would I just set the data fields to `None`, some default value, or don’t set them at all in the  `__init__` ?

Maybe I am just thinking about this wrong.

Example:

```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, arg_1, arg_2=0, ...):
        self.arg_1 = arg_1
        # or use
        self.arg_2 = arg_2
        # or use
        self.arg_3 = None

1037,1551797051.5984,Pilar,"<@Jimmy> Locally, I am running via PyCharm, but it also worked by running the script from the CLI directly -- something I am in the process of reconfirming right now. On Fedora, I am running from CLI. I also tried running via Jenkins job, which is how I am running the main part of the code. The script that Jenkins runs, we'll call it integration_runner.py lives in the root directory, and it imports several classes from files in src with no problem. Both src/ and task_scripts/ have empty __init__ files; My task script need the classes in src/ because it is a source control/Trello/Jira/TestRail integration, and that script uses the imported class methods that interact with those things as part of the initialization"
1037,1551797280.6013,Jimmy,afaik pycharm append some script to the `sys.path` so that might be why it work
1037,1551797329.6022,Pilar,"I figured PyCharm was probably doing something, which is why I wanted to reconfirm via git-bash terminal"

1037,1551797359.6026,Pilar,Will do!; <@Jimmy> figured I'd share here while also googling the new error I just got when trying to run from the command line on Fedora with the `-m` switch: `/usr/bin/python3.5: Relative module names not supported`
1037,1551798416.6092,Shawana,"Ehhhr.. another noob-question.. I#m trying to understand the logic behind some gerrymander-problem.. I have a list with possible_district_coordinates for every point (x, y) in a 5x5 coordinate-system that includes every valid district for that point so far (a district has 5 blocks, that are neighbors) - this part is working.. `all_district_possibilities = [get_possbile_districts(block) for block in blocks]`

Now I want to get a carthesian-product out of these possibilites, to check, if a product is a valid 5x5 zone.
`itertools.product(all_district_possibilities)` does not give me a combination of coordinates, I don't know why..

then I tried something to test manually, but this breaks, due to `too many statically nested blocks` (see snipper)


Ehm... looks odd though.. I'm clueless. How can I combine these items?"

1043,1551809248.6372,Rosamaria,"Quoting from a great article on Event Collaboration Architecture by Martin Flowler:
&gt;""Event cascades are good because something happens and as a result of a string of local logical event connections something indirect happens. Event cascades are bad because something happens and as a result of a string of local logical event connections something indirect happens. Event cascades usually look pretty obvious when they are described like this, but until you see them they can be very hard to spot. This is an area where *visualization systems* that can build a graph of event chains by querying meta-data from the systems themselves could be very handy.""


Another one:
&gt;""With Event Collaboration you don't know who is listening to the events until run-time - which in practice means you can only find the links between the components in configuration data - and there may be multiple areas of configuration data. As a result these interactions are hard to find, understand and debug. It is very helpful here to use *automated tools* that can display the configuration of components at run time so you can see what you have.""

1043,1551810171.6425,Jettie,I don't think having a generalized solution is even possible
1043,1551810403.6463,Rosamaria,absolutely true. lets see what we can afford to de-generalize to make it possible. maybe i have to follow a particular schema of events. maybe i have to use a complimentary client library with an event broker. i will still have immense flexibility to to make all sorts of applications with that.
1044,1551811864.6512,Dominga,"Question:

I have a `class Account` and `class InsufficientFundsError(Exception)`. Both reside in the module `account.py`.

An instance of `Account` raises a `InsufficientFundsError` within a member method if a particular condition is met.

In my main module, I am importing: `from account import Account`. My code in the main method calls a method with an argument that raises the `InsufficientFundsError`.

And it works. Now my question: Why does it? I thought I would have to import the custom exception as well, but it works without it, too."
1044,1551812239.6543,Clemmie,"<@Dominga> Is the code path that triggers the `InssufficientFundsError` getting run/tested? Python won’t normally cause an error until it is encountered at runtime, at which point you will get a `NameError`. Another possibility is that you have the code path wrapped in a greedy except (such as `except: ...` or `except Exception: ...`)"
1044,1551813844.6584,Dominga,"<@Clemmie> Thanks for the reply, and sorry for my late response.

It is being run and works as expected. I am using:
```
try: 
    # something
except InsufficientFundsError:
    # something
```

The error is raised by the account class in the account module and not within my code of the main module. Maybe that’s why? I am not importing the entire module, but just the class though. Which is why I am confused."
1044,1551813965.66,Clemmie,"So the snippet above is in your main module? Have you tested it to so that the error is actually raised by the account? If not then that `except` is not reached at runtime, and the `NameError` will not occur; put another way, run some code that will make `Account` raise that error in the main module, and then see if it still works"
1044,1551814555.6665,Dominga,"I’ve expressed myself unclear. Let me rephrase:

The exception is encountered at runtime and handled properly. The handler is in the account class. The main module just calls a void method of the account class. If as a result of this method, the account’s attribute would be set below 0, the InsufficientFundsError is raised within the account class, by the account class.

1046,1551817844.6771,Almeda,Are you using something like pip install -r requirements.txt to build out the environment?
1046,1551817901.6778,Hildegard,"right now I am, but I'd like to move the dependencies into setup.py for a proper package"
1045,1551818006.6782,Dominga,<@Clemmie> Thank you very much. That was helpful.
1046,1551818117.6809,Almeda,"For the requirements-driven method, you can reference another requirements file by putting the -r &lt;some other file&gt; right in the .txt file, and split them out into ""full"" and ""development"" requirements. More on that at <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36744143/how-can-i-define-multiple-requirement-files>  I'm less sure about doing it through setup.py."

1046,1551818284.682,Almeda,"If you don't mind me asking, what's the use case? Usually you're trying to go the other way around, where your dev environment has more packages than you want distributed."
1046,1551819857.6826,Hildegard,"team harmony :wink:; The idea is that we have a variety of internal packages that serve as libraries for a project. Sometimes a dev wants to be able to fiddle with one of the underlying libraries, as you would in develop mode.; the team harmony part is finding a single way of defining the dependencies that serves 1) the guy who doesn't care about the supporting libs, wants to treat them like blessed versions and is ok waiting 15 mins to pull in a new build, and 2) the gal who manually fiddles with PYTHONPATH for ""control"" because they need may need to work on all 15 libraries"
1047,1551820381.689,Rosemarie,Just looked at a neat walkthrough here: <https://realpython.com/modern-web-automation-with-python-and-selenium/>
1046,1551820412.6902,Hildegard,"doing `-e` in requirements.txt files gets close, but I think it would be ideal to specify things in `setup.py` and have a flag for dev power install for user 2 vs package install for user 1"
1046,1551821020.6905,Ashley,"interesting writeup, although selenium is more of a test automation tool, as it's meant to emulate user interaction. It's not a very good scraping tool.; <@Hildegard> Why not just host a private PyPI server?; oh sorry, misread; nevermind; but if you want to go that route, you should probably split things into separate pacakges; each with their own dependencies"
1046,1551821608.6953,Almeda,"I see that the Pillow project (only picking on them because I'm neck-deep in their source anyway) uses setup.py for its distribution, but a separate requirements.txt for its development, and its requirements.txt uses -e flags for local modules."

1046,1551822236.6979,Lillia,Yes! Generally it's only a good idea if know it will be relatively small.; Otherwise you risk really using a lot of CPU and memory just to get a `len` call.

Is there anyway to capture the `\s` before the table name, but not include it?
my example: <https://regex101.com/r/In747J/2>"
1050,1551828644.7112,Hildegard,"sounds like you want a capture group, put the table name part in parens; or put the space in the lookbehind and wrap the keyword options in a non-capturing group `(?: ... )`."
1050,1551829080.7128,Shirley,"I tried the lookbehind, but it complains that lookbehinds need to be a fixed width; and it is hard to account for the table pattern as it can be a varying mix of `db.shcema.table`, `shcema.table`, `#table`, etc."
1050,1551830186.716,Hildegard,"ah right, <@Shirley>, so capture the table name in a capture group `(&lt;tablename_regex&gt;)`. depending on how full strength you want this to be, you might end up needing a real parser. i give up on regexes if the syntax is detailed and i need something really robust."
1050,1551830327.7164,Shirley,"yeah, I might leave it as is and just `.strip()` it after words"
1053,1551833116.7176,Clayton,Still not sure the difference between 'docstrings' and 'comments'  ?
1053,1551833241.7178,Carlota,"Keep getting the following error: `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not ""ImportValue"") to str`.  Not sure how I can insert the `eks_cluster_name`."
1053,1551833560.7208,Sasha,"<@Clayton> A docstring is a Python literal quoted string in a specific position, like the start of a function, which is available to the software at runtime for help commands, etc. A comment, using `#`, can be sprinkled anywhere in the code, but it's invisible except to a human reading those lines. So the former is usually used for documentation, and the latter for notes to developers maintaining the app."
1053,1551833587.7211,Clayton,is it like logging ?
1053,1551833705.722,Sasha,"No, it's just fixed text, embedded in the program. Logging would be dynamic output."
1053,1551833745.7226,Clayton,isnt the stack trace enough for troubleshooting errors ?
1053,1551833960.7249,Sasha,"Well, that will tell you where an error was encountered, but not what the code was doing or why. Compare `x += (len(data) + 9) // 10` with `x += (len(data) + 9) // 10  # Split rows into batches of 10, rounded up`."
1053,1551834012.7253,Clayton,like a debugger output ?
1053,1551834060.7262,Sasha,"No, it's just a note from the programmer explaining what they were thinking, etc. or clarifying something which works but might be confusing to understand how it works."
1053,1551834109.727,Clayton,"comment = what the code does , docstring = why it it does what it does"
1053,1551834529.7285,Sasha,"It's more like docstring = what this function does, why you might want to call it, and what the parameters mean. Comment = how the function was implemented, in case you need to change how it works."
1053,1551835112.7298,Clayton,Ive been reading about it and i still dont see anything that really elevates it above comments
1053,1551835498.7308,Sasha,"The main difference is that it's accessible at runtime through `__doc__`, and is a standard place to look for documentation."
1053,1551836073.732,Clayton,"i saw that, you access it through the ipyhon / interactive prompt.  why not just look at the script to see the docstrings.  just dont get really get it"
1053,1551836155.7324,Sasha,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1054,1551836350.7334,Hiroko,"Consider documentation builders like Sphinx; &gt;&gt;&gt; Docstrings versus Block comments
These aren’t interchangeable. For a function or class, the leading comment block is a programmer’s note. The docstring describes the operation of the function or class"
1053,1551836508.7339,Hiroko,<https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/>; <@Clayton> :point_up: 
1053,1551836754.7347,Sasha,"Thanks, <@Hiroko>. I hadn't run across Doctest before... that's a cute hack."
1053,1551837251.7366,Bethany,The access to docstrings also makes it so ide can easily show you docs of functions you're calling. The fact that it's part of the language means the tooling can all work with it. The comments are not as easily accessible programmatically; Other languages don't all have a standard like this. It's big QoL improvement
1055,1551838591.738,Clayton,I think I don't know how to leverage the value of 'docstrings'; Is it like the 'man' or 'cat' command in Unix ?
1055,1551847194.7416,Candra,More like man than cat
1055,1551847198.7418,Stan,"<@Clayton> -- it's not like 'man' or 'cat'. Docstrings are a way of associating a help string with a class of function for example. It is possible to programmatically access the docstring using the `__doc__` property. So, it is easy to write code which fetches such docs.; manpages have a format, and are idependent of the tool; you could write standalone manpages and 'man' could show them to you as readable docs. Docstrings are designed to live along with your code; either as an explainer for the module (at the top of the file) ..or per class, function etc.; Tools like Sphinx which generate user-documentation, are able to parse through your code and pull out docstrings automatically. This makes it easy to generate API docs. Typical case would be a docstring mentioning it's arguments, return values, exceptions raised etc.; Example:
Look at the docstring for Flask's application object from the code here:
<https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/86bf9dca72cd188813e26ef5dd972101ef8983cf/flask/app.py#L72>

The restructured text (.rst) which Sphinx operates on has been asked to fetch info from the class and all its members.
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pallets/flask/master/docs/api.rst>
```
Application Object
------------------

.. autoclass:: Flask
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
```

In the generated API documentation, the content you see came from the docstring
<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#application-object>

By embedding help as docstrings, you also have an advantage of keeping docs close to the code. You'd update it if you updated your code."

I have minimal experience with databases and this is for a startup where I do *everything*, so the keys are that it’s relatively simple to setup, reliable and easy to have it communicate with other apps (will automate as much of the data flow as possible)

 - Users will on my website fill in simple information (text) -&gt; Stored in db, user profile is created
 - Documents with user information will also be automatically created from templates -&gt; stored in db, not accessible to user
 - A new process will access those documents and send with email
 - New information will be added along
 - Non-technical people must be able to easily access the data in the db

1069,1551895787.807,Nena,yup
1069,1551895812.8077,Lillia,Ok then you can `except some_exception_type:` and the parent will only catch that exception type; Whatever type `some_exception` is

1069,1551896072.8093,Lillia,I like click but it's also an extra thing to install. `argparse` is just fine unless you're making something complex.

1070,1551897287.8151,Magan,"Rando questions. Though im trying to implement something from a C# that uses the `ref` keyword. Which basically allows the value to be passed by reference so that all functions are working with the last modified value thru different functions/scopes. So Python doesnt have this, so Ive opted to use the variable in a `list()` and pass the list around in functions.....and it seems to mostly work fine? Although, Im having an issue that i havent been able to debug fully yet. Though im just curious, if there were known caveats that may cause it not to work as I expect?"
1069,1551897490.8152,Lillia,You should read about mutable and immutable types in Python. tl;dr immutable types are always by value and mutable types are always by reference. That's not quite how it works in Python but it's analogous to other languages.

Selenium isn't a headless browser, but rather an abstraction around the WebDriver protocol with some extra bits to unify behavior between browsers so you can have the same selenium code hopefully do the same thing on every browser. It communicates with the various drivers for each browser to control them either locally or remotely (it's all network requests, so you can have selenium talk to the drivers over a network if you want), and, ideally, it tries to simulate how a real person would interact with the website (albeit much, much faster). The browsers it controls are not headless by default, but some of them support being run headless and you can have Selenium spin up a headless instance if you tell it to do so.

Regarding performance, a long, long time ago, ~in a world wide web far away,~ xpath used to perform better than normal CSS selectors, but even then, only in certain circumstances, and not by much. Nowadays, CSS selectors perform much better across the board. You should always try to use CSS selectors for a number of reasons (e.g. front end developer will be able to understand them easily, they're simpler and easier to write), but performance should not be a concern, especially if you're running e2e tests with selenium (it's already going to chug along relative to other types of tests, so shaving off .01 seconds of a 20 minute test run isn't really worth it). The _only_ time you should use XPATH is it you need some sort of logic in your locator that CSS selectors just can't do (and even then, there's often ways around it). For example, if you need to find an element that happens to have an element inside it with a certain attribute value, XPATH is needed, because CSS selectors can't traverse up the node tree to the parents/ancestors."

1084,1551971164.9213,Eric,"<@Izetta> first off, i have never used selenium directly from python, mainly via robotframework and such .. but if the question was would using lxml be a good idea?  Afaik, and i might be very wrong - that probably wont work or if it does, it wouldnt probably provide any speed improvements.; because selenium would still be in the middle and for lxml to get its magic, you would still need to wait for within seleniun context for page ready (and any async requests that might trigger dom changes) and only then get the page source ..; and . afaik, you would be more interested in live dom than the just the html .."
1084,1551971326.9254,Izetta,<@Eric>  what is robotframework 
1084,1551971334.9256,Eric,"so,atleat from my pov, lxml is probably not what you are looking for.; <https://robotframework.org/> .. opensource automation framework ..; people will hate my for saying this but essentially:  ""Its like cucumber but with different syntax and written in python"""

1084,1551971507.9293,Eric,mm yes ?  but it will still be using selenium underneath it :smile:
1084,1551971570.9305,Izetta,"<@Eric>  then, I look into it "
1084,1551971614.9312,Eric,"so if you are familiar with sele &amp; python, robot itself wont add much except extra layer of abstraction .. *but* if not, keyword based automation might be a good fit. Depending in your requirements."

1084,1551973762.9368,Ashley,"<@Izetta> Selenium is actually a _terrible_ scraping tool. It's built to work like a user, so it will be slow in many areas, and refuse to cooperate in others. (e.g. if an element has text, but isn't ""visible"", selenium will tell you it has no text). Using a full browser in general is also super slow, so you may want to explore other options. Robot is also a testing framework, so it's not really gonna offer you anything"

1087,1551978820.9406,Ashley,<@Karoline> because it's not in the WebDriver spec. It's not a selenium issue
1087,1551978873.9425,Karoline,"I mean it is in the sense that they could get it, and choose not to.   I've seen them reply on issues that it's not what the tool is for as if it were some sort of philosophical issue."
1087,1551978925.9435,Ashley,"Aside from that, it's geared towards behaving as a user so you can test from as close to a user's perspective as you can in automation. Users don't care about return codes"
1087,1551978943.9442,Karoline,"Right, but it's not a user.  It's a machine."

1087,1551979041.9467,Ashley,That's not really a fair argument
1087,1551979078.948,Karoline,"it is - because it's precisely my point.  it's a philosophical argument rather than a practical argument, and one that falls apart under cursory inspection."
1087,1551979116.9487,Ashley,It's a middleman between code and user. There's no magical means of a computer behaving exactly like a user in a predicable and deterministic manner
1087,1551979168.9501,Karoline,right.  so it's useful to be able to use these signals to avoid needing magic
1087,1551979251.9505,Ashley,"If you care about the status code, why are you trying to use Selenium? Why not hit the API directly?"
1087,1551979273.9508,Karoline,what API?  like use curl?; or requests or something?
1087,1551979307.9512,Ashley,"Yeah; The API for the backed, whatever form that takes"
1087,1551979336.9521,Karoline,many websites don't have a backend API
1087,1551979381.9533,Ashley,I'll rephrase; Why don't you hit the website's server directly?; Why bother going through the browser?
1087,1551979428.9548,Joette,"I get the objection here, b/c you may be checking status based on specific input added via the browser"
1087,1551979446.9554,Karoline,because sometimes the most reliable way to get data from a site is to be as close to a user as possible.
1087,1551979461.9558,Joette,"""For a logged in user, after do X and then Y and then Z verify that the resulting status code is XXX""; that oughtn't be the primary test, but you may want to check that too"
1087,1551979496.9582,Ashley,"You can easily get around that by grabbing the cookies/user agent from the browser, and using them in your request"
1087,1551979498.9584,Joette,"verify both the visual result, e.g. error message, _and_ that the server responds with a specific code in _that_ status; but if you're _already doing these tests_; the prescribed solution is to use testing middleware"
1087,1551979533.9599,Karoline,"from which browser, the one driven by selenium?  that's sort of rube goldberg-esque"
1087,1551979559.961,Ashley,"Selenium drives the browser, not the other way around"
1087,1551979568.9617,Karoline,that's exactly what I said?
1087,1551979571.9618,Ashley,"Sorry, sent before your edit"
1087,1551979575.9621,Karoline,ah; in the end I think I ended up parsing the performance logs for it

1087,1551979808.9689,Karoline,"the proxy is a huge hassle, the performance logs route isn't too bad when you figure it out - I've been meaning to put up a blog post on it; the big issue of course is that since there's a philosophical opposition to it, I wouldn't be shocked if this will break at some point; because that's happened in the past"
1087,1551979989.9708,Ashley,"The proxy is actually pretty easy to set up. Someone even made a python package for it, `browsermobproxy`; What would break?"
1087,1551980086.9729,Karoline,"my setup was containerized so that was a bit weird as my selenium client and the headless chrome instance were in different containers.  I imagine it could be setup, but it was more effort figuring it out than the performance log route"
1087,1551980096.9731,Sasha,"<@Nena> Have a look at `collections.defaultdict`, which allows you to have a default value for missing dictionary keys."
1087,1551980196.9737,Ashley,I mean what would break as a result of it being a philosophical opposition?
1087,1551980228.9743,Karoline,"It's just less than a priority, with approaches in the past messages I've seen on the web seemed to almost relish taking the ability to do it away.; So who knows - but there have been other ways to do it and they've been removed/stopped working and the general response is just ""welp"""
1088,1551980309.975,Nena,"thank you <@Sasha>, let me check that out."
1087,1551980402.9755,Ashley,So you mean their opposition may break
1087,1551980550.976,Karoline,I mean techniques currently used to get the return code.  But if we want to continue the conversation probably should go to #testing_
1087,1551980611.9769,Jenice,wow selenium doesn't provide a status code? What does it tell you if you go looking for an element but the server responded with a 503 or something?
1087,1551980619.9771,Sasha,"You might run into a little weirdness since you want to have a function as the value, which `defaultdict` might interpret as a constructor instead of the value itself. So you might need to wrap that in a `lambda`."
1087,1551980686.9779,Nena,"running by the docs, will work something out. Thanks again for the guide."
1087,1551980694.9785,Ashley,It would tell you the element is not found
1087,1551980699.9789,Karoline,Probably best for us to take this to #testing_
1087,1551980705.9791,Ashley,Yeah

1087,1551980947.9821,Karoline,"yeah I really need to just get it done - I actually have a part 1 of using nightwatch with headless chrome in docker that I wanted to get out as sort of a primer for that but there's something weird about the setup I wrote in there, it doesn't work like the one I had previously used does.  so gotta figure that out first."
1089,1551981658.9846,Dominga,"Hi there, I might have an odd question:

I am using a third party library docx-mailmerge, to populate word mergefields (placeholders).

I have a field that doesn’t always have a value, but when it does, I’d like to append a space at the end. However, the library seems to strip that space.

Now my question, is there a whitespace character that isn’t stripped by function such as str.strip()?"

1089,1551982312.9899,Clemmie,if you need all lines from all files replace that line with `new_lines += file_handle.readlines()`
1089,1551982354.9903,Granville,ah! crud. Thanks. Something funny seems to happen though. I'm not sure if the second for statement is causing it but my output suddenly goes to every character in a word being treated as a line in the file
1089,1551982688.9907,Clemmie,"how are you printing it?; if you are iterating through newlines a string is a list, and will spit out each char"
1089,1551983202.9922,Granville,"ah, I have another function it runs thru. That might be the issue. If I call the `printalllinesinfiles()` function, it works fine. Thanks for the help!"

1090,1551986328.9989,Nenita,I will have to design some system to pull the data frequently and store the info in a database. it has to have some sort of automation
1090,1551986336.9991,Ashley,why are you pulling the data from the SD car if they're IP cameras?
1090,1551986345.9993,Nenita,"lpr cameras more specifically; one sec. i should have specified more in the beginning.; we plan to have 11 lpr cameras over 11 locations and will need to compare that data with our database. it will need to be automated therefore I need to design some system to pull the data from the 11 cameras. There is plenty software designed for this, but the camera is what does the lpr - not the software - so that is why i am using python rather than installing software on every single computer."
1090,1551986533.0026,Ashley,Ipr?
1090,1551986541.0029,Nenita,license plate recognition
1090,1551986558.0031,Ashley,lol wut; what's the brand/model of these cameras?
1090,1551986699.0038,Nenita,<https://digital-watchdog.com/productdetail/DWC-MB44iALPR/>; that exact camera from that exact provider.
1090,1551986751.0044,Ashley,"hmmm; looks like they don't recognize what the plate actually says, just that it's a license plate; and it gets a clean image of it"
1090,1551986857.0064,Nenita,it has the lpr built in. it only stores the image and text of the plate for a limited period. all the extra software from dw that i dont want to install is for viewing the cameras. the software does no part of the license plate recognition. that is why I am choosing to design something in python to just pull and compare the data.
1090,1551986909.0071,Ashley,I got something for you that I think you'll love; it's not python; it's node
1090,1551986918.0078,Nenita,js?

1090,1551986943.0092,Ashley,javascript*; (very different from java)
1090,1551986971.0102,Nenita,duly noted.
1090,1551986973.0103,Ashley,"Shinobi has a plugin system, and one of the plugins is OpenALPR (license plate recognition)"
1090,1551986983.0107,Nenita,oh sweet
1090,1551986993.0111,Ashley,but OpenALPR actually pulls the license plate from the video feed; and figures out what the text is
1090,1551987027.0122,Nenita,thats perfect. that is exactly the answer i was hoping for.
1090,1551987030.0123,Ashley,"it also supports video stream pass through, so you don't have to re-encode the video stream to store it; it's literally the only security camera software system I've found that does this"
1090,1551987119.0142,Nenita,has anyone ever told you you are awesome?
1090,1551987131.0143,Ashley,"it also supports handling multiple streams from a single camera so you can do stuff like use the high quality feed for live streaming, and a lower quality feed for license plate recognition (easier to process); lol yeah, but it's always fun hearing it :joy:; do you have any docs for that camera?"
1090,1551987156.0152,Nenita,lmao :laughing:; i believe there is a pdf on the site if not on google

1100,1552033521.0522,Eric,"depends, could you elaborate ?; on short, answer is yes.. there's nothing that prevents ""reading windows files"" in python / linux, if the file accessible somehow. Another question is if the file actually resides in windows partition, you need to mount the partition first and depending on your linux and what filesystem that partition is, it might be problematic but that part has nothing to do with python itself."
1099,1552037725.0564,Natosha,thanks <@Eric>; can you suggest a library that I can use for that scenario?
1100,1552037789.0577,Eric,for which scenario ?; for reading a file or for mounting ?  i dont think you should rely on  a library but properly configure your system ..
1100,1552038063.0586,Natosha,for reading a file; i did some research and I found pysmb; can I use that or is there anything else you can recommend?; that is easier

1100,1552042093.07,Natosha,yes but same network
1102,1552043080.0704,Yaeko,Set up a network share on the linux server and mount that on the windows machines?; That way you will have easy access to the file for scripting (and backup/version control/whatever you need) while the windows users can edit it as they want; Additional advantage is that multiple windows machines can the edit the file as well.

1104,1552071783.0825,Carlota,that’s correct!

1104,1552071821.0837,Carlota,I need to let the other ones like `${BootstrapArguments}` because those will be _substituted_ by the `Sub` Troposphere lib.
1104,1552071890.0845,Sasha,"Alternately, you can use old-style string formatting with `%s` instead of braces."
1104,1552071994.0847,Carlota,"like so: ```/etc/eks/bootstrap.sh %s ${BootstrapArguments}```; ah, no; that’s wrong; ```def generate_user_data(eks_cluster_name):
    certificate_auth = """"""\
    #!/bin/bash
    set -o xtrace
    /etc/eks/bootstrap.sh %s ${BootstrapArguments}

            --resource NodeGroup
            --region ${AWS::Region}
            """"""%(eks_cluster_name)
    return certificate_auth```; that way"
1104,1552072121.0862,Sasha,Yep. The other thing you can do is use `{{ }}` for your literal braces that you don't want substituted for.
1104,1552072243.0867,Carlota,"would that look like something like this:
```/etc/eks/bootstrap.sh {ClusterName} {{${BootstrapArguments}}}```"
1104,1552072316.088,Sasha,"No, it would be like `{ClusterName} ${{BootstrapArguments}}`. The `format()` will convert the double braces back to singles as part of the substitution, but it won't look for a variable for them."
1104,1552072346.0882,Carlota,"oh ok, that make sense!"

I have table library that is taking javascript array of objects e.g. `[ {name: 'John', surname: 'Doe' } ]` and rendering it in table.
In Python I used to do `render(request, 'users/list.html, { 'objects': serializers.serialize(User.objects.all()) })` but I was missing URLs and I don't want to generate them in JavaScript. I would like to enhance serialized data with `get_absolute_url` so my serialized object in JavaScript has `user.absolute_url` (string value).
I did not find a way how to do that with in built Django serializer `from django.core import serializers` so I plugged in DRF.
But with DRF I don't know how to render JSON to regular HTML template."

I want a function that collects the values `<mailto:some@email.com|some@email.com>` and `twitter` from the url, and pass them along to a url inside my html doc.

Would I be able to call within the exception?

Python objects have a `__hash__` method that returns ""something that can be hashed"", which in cPython is an integer; So there isn't much reason to not just accept any ""hashable"" object as the key; in that case, the code would be; ```

1172,1552516840.5008,Ashley,"<@Tasha> this is basically just inheritance. Python will catch the error, since it's in a `try` block, and then see if you want to catch that particular error by checking your `except` blocks in sequence (much like if/elif/else blocks). Every class in Python has a linearized chain of ancestors. This linearization is determined through a process called ""Method Resolution Order"" (MRO), which can be tricky, but there's a great talk by Raymond Hettinger called ""Super Considered Super"" which does a great job of explaining it. With the MRO chain established, Python can quickly and easily check to see if you want to catch that error"

1172,1552516954.5031,Ashley,"In terms of your example, it would be caught (assuming you raised the exception in the try block) because the child exception _is_ its parent in a certain sense.

1172,1552517506.5117,Ashley,"That's part of the reason you would inherit; Think of a class called ""Fruit"""
1172,1552517525.5126,Tasha,ok
1172,1552517553.5134,Ashley,"It has all the info you could have about, and all the things you could do with a generic fruit, but it isn't any fruit in particular"
1172,1552517563.5137,Tasha,right
1172,1552517573.5142,Ashley,"Then inherit from it and make an Apple class; That class gets all the things from the Fruit class, but has the opportunity to add or adjust things"
1172,1552517631.5159,Tasha,"``` class Fruit():
    taste = ""sweet""
    color = ""defualt""

class Apple(Fruit):
    color = ""red"" ```"
1172,1552517644.5162,Ashley,"Close; Not all fruits are sweet, but you get the idea"
1172,1552517663.5168,Tasha,ok; so how do i use Fruit(); and some how call all its child classes
1172,1552517696.5178,Ashley,Why would you want to?
1172,1552517710.5184,Tasha,except Fruit as err; lol
1172,1552517748.5196,Ashley,The parent doesn't  usually need to know about its descendents
1172,1552517755.52,Tasha,yes thats right
1172,1552517755.5201,Ashley,But yes; That's how you would do it for an exception
1172,1552517766.5207,Tasha,i havent come across this before in 5 years of developing lol; i have studied IOC container DI; SOLId
1172,1552517787.5218,Ashley,You haven't come across inheritance in 5 years of development?
1172,1552517789.522,Tasha,"etc; functional, erlang; and i dont know how this works lol; i understand inheritance; solid principles; etc; but i dont understand how python Exceptions reach down to the child classes"
1172,1552517922.5265,Ashley,"Oh, yeah, they don't; The parent class can be completely unaware that it has descendants"
1172,1552517969.5299,Tasha,I have read that Python's inheritance tree goes upwards untl the base class
1172,1552517979.5304,Ashley,Python in the one checking that the exception that was raised inherits from any of the exception classes you want to catch
1172,1552517993.5309,Clemmie,"They don't, and it isn't exception specific. When you had except parent it caught child because child inherited from parent. Python, via the mro, knows that ; It is the reverse if what you said really. Child knows it inherits from parent,but parent doesn't necessarily know what inherits from itself"
1172,1552518079.5349,Ashley,"there's ""old"" style classes, and ""new"" style classes. I believe in Python 3, old style classes don't exist anymore, but basically, the difference is that in old style classes, they don't extend all the way up to the `object` class, and in new style classes, they do"
1172,1552518091.5355,Tasha,can you give me an example outside of Exceptions whereby  python can expose a classes child /sub classes?
1172,1552518109.5363,Ashley,that doesn't really happen often; you'd have to implement that yourself
1172,1552518119.5371,Clemmie,"So, effectively, when you did except parent, child says ""I am a type of parent"" and is caught"
1172,1552518125.5373,Ashley,"like we said, the parent is unaware of the children"
1172,1552518148.5379,Tasha,ahh great thanks
1172,1552518156.5383,Clemmie,Using parent/child as the terms also confuses it a bit
1172,1552518164.5386,Ashley,yeah
1172,1552518191.5399,Tasha,super / sub classes
1172,1552518195.5404,Ashley,"<@Tasha> make a class that inherits from a few other classes, and then call `__mro__` on it (I think that's the attribute)"
1172,1552518208.541,Tasha,ok cool!
1172,1552518209.5413,Ashley,that might clear it up a bit
1172,1552518214.5416,Clemmie,"Like apple knows it is a fruit, and will respond as such, but fruit doesn't need to know what fruits there are"
1172,1552518225.5419,Tasha,"thats it!; haha now i understand; So python must be looking at any class that extends from Exception , right down the tree of subclasses?"
1172,1552518281.5439,Ashley,"yep. Python basically sees you're trying to catch `Fruit`, and goes `if Fruit in Apple.__mro__: # actually catch it`; oh, no it doesn't really care about all classes that extend from exception; it pretty much does `if Fruit in Apple.__mro__: # actually catch it`"
1172,1552518340.5456,Tasha,ahh so its looks here: SubClassException(Exception) &lt; -------- here
1172,1552518344.5457,Ashley,because it saw `catch Fruit`; kind of; MRO is a lot more complex than what's listed in there
1172,1552518367.5464,Tasha,ok; is this in Java?
1172,1552518394.5476,Ashley,"watch Super Considered Super, and it should explain it pretty well; Java doesn't have this; Java actually has what I think is called a ""death triangle of inheritance""; or something like that"
1172,1552518443.55,Tasha,"I wondered how my boss new how this works, he isnt great at all at Python, he comes from Java/ ruby"
1172,1552518447.5504,Ashley,"basically, multiple inheritance can go awry very quickly in Java"
1172,1552518464.5508,Clemmie,"Well, does java have what exactly?"
1172,1552518466.5509,Ashley,Python avoids that problem with MRO
1172,1552518515.5518,Tasha,"I just wondered how he knew straight away i can just use our custom parent exception class and all the sub classes would be caught as well; its really a head teaser; brain teaser, rather lol; but thanks guys; explained very well; im going to quiz him tomorrow on the technicals of this"
1172,1552518581.5534,Ashley,ah found it
1172,1552518582.5535,Tasha,im sure he would have no idea or MRO
1172,1552518602.5541,Ashley,"Java has what's called the ""deadly diamond of death"" (I'm not making that up)"
1172,1552518616.5543,Tasha,]haha; love it
1172,1552518651.5549,Raguel,I want to know etymology of that phrase now
1172,1552518683.5558,Ashley,it's a diamond of inheritance; and it kills your program dead; deadly death
1172,1552518704.5569,Clemmie,"I mean, java does have generics, which can get you close to mro like behavior, in a staticly typed, verbose way"
1172,1552518801.5571,Tasha,ok; rightmost depth first resolution; does that mean literally 'right'? lol
1172,1552518912.5606,Clemmie,"The best thing about the mro is the deterministic way it identifies in what order things are inherited when using multi-inheritence, based on the declaration order. (Which is the deadly diamond issue)"
1172,1552518920.5608,Tasha,thank god i never learnt Ruby; haha; yes just read it uses the base class's tuple order
1172,1552518971.5624,Clemmie,Exactly
1172,1552518989.5629,Tasha,but Ruby's : rightmost depth first resolution; lol; is that literally : 'right'; so it would always take the right side of the diamond?; before the left class; sorry getting off topic
1172,1552519079.5659,Clemmie,It will always look first to the rightmost defined class for a method/variable resolution
1172,1552519113.5667,Tasha,ok; so then it's a form or module resolution
1175,1552519146.5678,Clemmie,That's precisely what it is
1172,1552519150.568,Tasha,"method, rather; yes; man thanks so much\; !; learnt something new this evening, thanks guys"
1172,1552519224.5698,Ashley,:+1:

1172,1552519535.5723,Tasha,haha; great channel btw; just found it tonight
1176,1552520131.5742,Tasha,are you guys working in python roles?
1175,1552520350.5746,Clemmie,"Most of the regulars do, yes"
1176,1552521050.5755,Nieves,Not me... Python I use for personal projects.
1176,1552522151.5761,Tasha,"ok cool, yea ive been full time python for the last 3 months; before did Node, Erlang, VB; loved python for a long time though; was tempted to try out Go but Python just keeps calling me back lol"
1177,1552524194.5797,Nieves,Go is weird; I see its use though

1177,1552526164.5875,Adolfo,"Question:
In Python 3.6 this code block fails with `complaining that config is not a module`
```Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py

In python 3.5 this works.
```
Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py

To make it work on python 3.6 I had to do
`from config import Config`

1179,1552529085.5935,Nieves,"403 is unauthorized so you prolly don't have the right perms or whatever.; Also, which version of Python and the like is used in the course?"

1188,1552578311.6677,Jenniffer,Hey guys! Hope you all are doing good. I am kinda new with Python and I am trying to read about how to create a transcription software (where I can automate certain things and export the transcription to word or any kind of word processor). Any ideas on where should I start?
1187,1552578339.6684,Bethany,you mean transcribe from audio to text ?
1187,1552578388.6695,Ursula,"When you say ""strategy"", could you elaborate?"
1187,1552578413.67,Bethany,"<https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html>; strategies are used to generate test values; so a ""float"" strategy would generate [NaN, 0.0, inf, -1.0] and so on"

1185,1552578499.6711,Ursula,Thanks <@Hiroko> for helping me last night!
1187,1552578531.6718,Bethany,yeah the post above mentioned the library and it reminded me :slightly_smiling_face:
1187,1552578540.672,Jenniffer,"Yes. Though in Linguistics,we do not use the automated ones that type it for you. We prefer to type it ourselves since we have conventions and symbols to use that programs don't do (maybe in the future, I could come up with that)"
1187,1552578583.6728,Ursula,"Ah okay, hopefully you can make a strategy out of it then :thumbsup:"
1187,1552578611.6737,Bethany,So you have your typed notes and you want to convert to a different format?
1187,1552578633.674,Jenniffer,Not exactly; :thinking_face:
1187,1552578655.6747,Bethany,"could you give an example of what your input is, and what you want to change it to?"

1187,1552579344.6813,Bethany,alright now i understand :slightly_smiling_face:
1187,1552579365.6818,Jenniffer,or easier for CONversation ANalysis lol
1187,1552579405.6825,Bethany,"so do the (0.5) mean pause of 0.5 seconds, like it's measured?; At any rate, I think this is a pretty hard thing to do"
1187,1552579499.6838,Jenniffer,yes
1187,1552579510.6842,Bethany,the pauses are the easiest part to automate
1187,1552579580.6855,Jenniffer,Remember that all I need is to make typing easier. The software shouldn't make it for me
1187,1552579614.6865,Bethany,oh well to be honest a text editor might be the simplest
1187,1552579616.6868,Carlo,basically a very specialized text editor then
1187,1552579616.6869,Jenniffer,"rather, the software should just give me the tools to type the symbols and pauses"
1187,1552579619.687,Bethany,you just want line numbers?
1187,1552579652.6878,Jenniffer,kinda?; lol
1187,1552579674.6891,Bethany,do they get more complicated than `:::` and `(0.5)`? Cuz just typing those is probably the easiest
1187,1552579674.6892,Carlo,"<@Jenniffer> IMHO you'd be better off with custom snippets and basically any decent text/code editor, no?; there probably are ways to setup emmet-like expansion, like 5*: expanding to ::::: but Im not sure how quicker/easier you could realistically make it :confused:"
1187,1552579856.6911,Jenniffer,"<@Bethany> This are pretty much the symbols; <@Carlo> not sure, that could help though"
1187,1552579944.6929,Bethany,perhaps you could create a simple shorthand for the other symbols like `=&gt;` and `-&gt;` or something
1187,1552579944.693,Carlo,pretty sure snippets would be doable for most of these...
1187,1552579952.6932,Jenniffer,I was trying to figure it out with a GUI but still
1187,1552579976.694,Bethany,then find and replace
1187,1552579982.6942,Jenniffer,"Nah, I can change the symbols of a widely use system"
1187,1552579990.6945,Carlo,"with the amount of stuff youd have to cram in there though, would a GUI really make this easier?"
1187,1552580001.6948,Jenniffer,^ good pint; There is a transcription program I know in Linguistics; but I cant even open it in my computer since it old and wont even run on my mac; plus it's written in c++ and no idea about that
1187,1552580071.6966,Hiroko,"seems like keyboard macros would be the best to do here; or shortcuts; that way, you could use it with a regular text editor"
1187,1552580124.6976,Bethany,"yeah I think that's the best, it might be slow for a day or so but I bet you'll be super fast in no time"
1187,1552580280.6989,Jenniffer,"I'll try a specialized text editor plus this is a personal project. It might or might not work; Awesome, thank you guys!"
1187,1552580410.7,Bethany,"yeah unfortunately the only thing I can think of to make this easier is to automate it, which would probably take a specialized neural net"
1187,1552580487.7001,Joette,"the only strategy creation I've done myself has been with composite strategies, but my short answer (er, guess) would be ""why not?"""

1190,1552586822.7152,Otelia,could you simply explain why the other code wasn't working?; if that's possible to articulate
1190,1552587073.7158,Carina,"I’ll try my best! All of the issues you were running into were syntax errors. It would likely be a good idea to check out the tutorial on the official docs site: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html> — The specific syntax errors you had were: 1. Invalid/inconsistent tabs; Python uses tabs to denote blocks of code (effectively “scope”), whereas other languages use things like curly braces (`{` and `}`) to denote blocks of code. 2. The `assert` keyword has a specific invocation pattern. You need an expression to assert, and more generally `assert`ing an object will _evaluate_ your expression in an attempt to confirm that it is “Truthy” (i.e. using `bool(expression)` will return `True`), otherwise it will raise an `AssertionError`.; In your case specifically, you’re using the python shell, which is an interactive program where you type code directly into the interpreter. It’s still a python interpreter and still requires valid python syntax, so tabs are still a requirement. The tricky thing about the python shell is that it’s not really practical to build any significant/major behavior through the interactive interpreter, which is why I suggested putting your code in a file instead and running it using the `python my_tests.py` command.; Further, the `if __name__ == '__main__': test_all()` line is what tells python what code to run. This is more or less standard boiler plate for python applications/code, it’s somewhat analogous to other language “main” functions. For example, in java you’d use `public static void main(String[] args)`, in C it’s `int main()`, etc. etc.; I hope that’s clear, but definitely let me know if I can clarify this further."

1203,1552677250.7698,Lynelle,adding a vertex to an adjacency matrix is quoted at O(v^2) - if python uses a list of lists - wouldn't it be just O(v) ?
1203,1552677366.7722,Clemmie,For a list of list you need a nested loop - assuming an n x n size a nested loop is O(n^2)
1203,1552677602.7747,Bethany,what is the structure used for the adjacency matrix? Sparse matrix format like CSR style?; 2D array?
1203,1552677615.775,Lynelle,None; 2d array; I think it's still O(v) - you don't need a nested loop
1203,1552677639.7761,Clemmie,How are you iterating through the rows?; that is the first loop
1203,1552677645.7766,Bethany,"well if you're adding a connection to an existing node, it should be constant time"
1203,1552677650.7768,Clemmie,then each row is a loop
1203,1552677668.7773,Bethany,adding a new node would require reallocating the whole thing more than likely
1203,1552677670.7774,Lynelle,"yes, adding/removing an edge is O(1)"
1203,1552677709.7783,Bethany,"generally adjacency matrix if it's large would be represented in sparse form, which is usually more of a dict of 1d arrays; or rather, two 1d arrays i think"
1203,1552677773.7791,Lynelle,pseudocode would be like; `for r in rows: r.append(0)`
1203,1552677802.78,Bethany,"so you could imagine adding a new vertex would be closer to allocate(v) and append(v), where the append is amortized constant"
1203,1552677805.7801,Lynelle,"then; `list.append([0,0,0,1,0])`"
1203,1552677926.7815,Clemmie,where did you get list?
1203,1552677947.7817,Lynelle,it's just the entire list; first step is adding a 0 or 1 to the end of each row; second step is appending a list - basically the last row of the 2d array
1203,1552678004.7827,Clemmie,Did you see this discussion on Stack Exchange - <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297730/why-adding-a-vertex-in-a-graph-represented-using-an-adjacency-matrix-takes-ov>
1203,1552678027.7831,Lynelle,"yep; there's another SO thread that says it's implementation dependent; in a 2d array list of lists in python, we don't have to re-allocate the entire thing"
1203,1552678068.7837,Clemmie,"Right - that looks like the canonical algorithm is v^2, but fairly simple to do better"
1203,1552678070.784,Bethany,yeah depending on growth schemes and memory allocators its different
1203,1552678094.7844,Lynelle,thanks guys!
1203,1552678101.7846,Bethany,are your edges directed?
1203,1552678134.7848,Lynelle,"in that green picture i posted - I guess they would be - 0 points to 1, and 1 points to 0"
1203,1552678211.785,Bethany,So it's symmetric matrix if that's always the case; Or undirected
1203,1552678378.7854,Lynelle,I could see using a dict of 1d arrays; kind of like an adjacency list
1203,1552678642.7858,Bethany,"Also, if you know how many nodes exist ahead of time, or even a guess you can always pre-allocate"

1204,1552679678.7902,Jonas,"```class YourCustomObject(TheObjectYouWantToOverride):
     def __hash__(self):
          ...```; should do the thing; you can’t override a __hash__ method of an existing type; for example, you can’t modify the `__hash__` of a tuple or a string; you _can_ with monkey patching only for pure-python objects (i.e not builtins), but it’s hard because it’s not something you really need or want to do"

Use case is: in Australia our weather bureau publishes near-real-time weather radar images that represent storm activity as pixels overlaid on a map. Severe storm cells are represented with black pixels (decreasing down there to brown, red, orange, yellow, green blue etc). Black storm cells often represent hail storms. So, I would like to capture the most recent image (this part is easy), compare it against a 'clear weather' radar image, and perform some sort of activity if specifically the count of black pixels is higher in the current version of the image.

1220,1552863133.8931,Marth,"Kinda a ""high level"" question (so not sure if this is the right channel).  I've been spending a fair amount of time digging into Pandas (and I really enjoy it!).  Both tutorials as well as using it to automate some internal reporting.  I'm wondering if I might start to suffer ""when all you have is a hammer...everything looks like a nail"" mentality.  Basically, using pandas when a simple list or dictionary might work better.  At the end of the day, I suppose as long as it works ""right"" there's not a huge problem with using pandas (except perhaps some performance issues? but for what I generally do, this isn't a major concern).  Anyone have any thoughts regarding if there is a good way to know (or questions I should be asking myself) to identify 'X' as well suited to Pandas and 'Y' better served by a dictionary, list or other 'internal' data data structures?  Thanks!"
1221,1552863537.8949,Sasha,"I'm not an expert, but I'd say that Pandas is a good tool for multidimensional data (rows and columns, or more), whereas native Python data structures are nicely suited for one-dimensional data (lists, key-and-value, etc.)."
1221,1552863588.8954,Hiroko,"also, pandas is pretty heavyweight to install; since it relies on numpy, IIRC; would also suggest that knowing how things work behind the code is invaluable too, so if/when the case comes, you can know when you should do your own thing vs bring in the entire lib dependency stack when its just used in a couple small things"

1222,1552886324.903,Sasha,"Gotcha. You may need to implement your own color-space conversion on a pixel-by-pixel basis instead of relying on OpenCV for that. Alternately, can you perform the conversion on the original square-pixel image first before the hex step?; In general, I would not expect things to ""just work"" between OpenCV and the hex-image libraries."
1222,1552886692.9038,Josef,what do you mean by performing the original sqaure-pixel image first?
1222,1552886807.904,Sasha,"Well, you appear to be calling `cvtColor()` to convert the image to grayscale. Can you do that on the original JPEG instead?"
1222,1552886940.9042,Josef,"yes of course, so you mean to say I perform OpenCV processing first before converting the image to hexagonal pixel? Doesn't it change the main goal of hexagonal image processing where we convert image to hex then do some image processing after?"
1222,1552887074.9044,Sasha,"Depends on what your goal is, I guess. But the main point is that you probably shouldn't expect OpenCV to operate on hexagonal images, so you may have to implement your own image processing."

I want it to be Like this one ""cv2.filter2D(img, cv2.CV_8UC3, g_kernel)"" because I already have the filter for hexagonal Image but the problem lies on applying the filter on the resampled image."
1222,1552887819.9048,Sasha,"No idea, I'm afraid. You know a lot more about hexagonal images than I do. It's not at all obvious how to generalize 2D filters to hex pixels since the axes are no longer orthogonal. Sounds like some math may be necessary to figure that out."

what is it grammar in python"
1224,1552898395.9085,Russ,If you're asking how do we call such constructions in python it's list comprehension

1224,1552899908.9151,Russ,"ehh.. that particular construction is valid for everything ""list-like"" (sets, tuples, etc). And in `char_dic` you're using dictionary comprehension, so it's valid too, but it has slightly different syntax. But I recommend you to read about comprehensions in general. It's a very powerful tool that save tons of time. And if you're ready for it, then generators as well."

The yolo plugin can also be configured to store a record of whatever it detected in a DB. You could probably use it to do what you want. I'm not sure how your whole system ties together, so it might not be worth it though"
1229,1552930153.9726,Granville,"all, I have a programming approach question may be specific to Python. When parsing strings containing text and delimiters, is it much better to parse syntax on-the-spot as you're iterating through each word/delimiter or pull out what's marked by delimiters, parse, then reinsert back into the marked placeholders? I guess it's more of a style question but I'm trying to see whether certain styles or approaches are favored over others when working with communities of programmers."
1227,1552930354.9737,Marla,"Depending on the consistency of the delimiters, you could utilize regex capture groups."
1229,1552930449.9747,Granville,that's what I was thinking. I'm still trying to determine how to best approach that as the delimiters can vary from a set of enclosed brackets to single colons
1229,1552930568.9766,Sasha,"If the delimiters are cleanly indicated, I tend to `split()` first and tackle each piece second. The exception is when you have issues like ""oh, no, that comma is actually within quotes, so it's not a delimiter"", where you need to parse the contents as you go just to understand how to split things."
1229,1552930705.9777,Granville,"that makes sense, thanks"

I'm honestly really puzzled.; Maybe try inserting a `print(row)` above it to see if the variable is known outside of the generator context?; Is there any chance you have an editor that might have used a different Unicode character in your source code, so that you've effectively got like `for röw in reader`?; Tabs instead of spaces messing up the indent levels so it thinks it's not actually inside the `for` loop?

1236,1552952705.0046,Sasha,"By the way, indexing `row` by number I don't think will work, but that should produce a different error. Also, you don't have to skip the header with a `DictReader` since it reads in the header itself to create the dict keys."
1236,1552959931.005,Rosalia,Thank you Ed! I got the solution. I can paste it for you if you're curious. And you're suggestions are right.

1237,1552960412.0056,Sasha,So what was the thing that changed to make the error go away? 
1236,1552960562.0058,Rosalia,"I think the two main problems were the for loop (didn't need it) and also taking out the 'included_cols' line, since as you said, the dictreader read the columns.; Now I need to figure out how to delete 109,000+ model objects that got created during all the testing! Maybe i should just delete the database and recreate it?"
1236,1552960735.0062,Sasha,Hmmm. Still doesn't really explain the NameError. Maybe I'll chalk that up to VSCode getting into a weird state where it was executing a cached .pyc instead of the latest source...
1236,1552960835.0064,Rosalia,I guess I mean not the for loop but the data line under it. Still learning myself!
1236,1552962866.0068,Raguel,Unable to reproduce `NameError`. It gives `KeyError` and that makes sense.

1253,1553071117.0907,Yaeko,"<@Tanja> Not entirely sure whats the question is, but look up .format or f-strings instead of the %s syntax, much clearer and easier to read (and %s is a bit out of fashion).

1254,1553071262.0927,Yaeko,"<@Jamey> Not entirely sure what the .env file means, is it used by some framework? But normally enviroment variables are just strings, so you need to sort it out when using it.; If you use `os.path.join` (or similar function from `pathlb`) to create a path, the separators are sorted out by that function."
1254,1553071361.0952,Jamey,It is a file used to store values that could be set using `export` e.g. (in this case) `export FOLDER=home` in the terminal
1254,1553071730.0994,Russ,I don't think using directory name as a string in an `.env` file is something bad. I guess you'll be using it later with something like `Path.joinpath(os.environ.get('FOLDER'))` or `os.path.join(...)` then no need to worry about slashes (either way you might want to use `os.sep` for something specific).

I want to identify a niche for tweets by putting 10 tweets in one word count, and then comparing it with a file that holds keywords.
So let's say a user posts a sentence like `Want to the gym today and I've never had such sore muscles!` , i want to match this with one big file that holds keywords to multiple niches.

```Fitness { gym, muscle, muscles, soremuscle,gymrat}
fashion {clothing,legging,hoodie} 
niche {keyword1,keyword2,keyword3} 
```

So I want to analyze my text, count the amount of keywords that return and then say: Fitness niche is most counted, followed by fashion...

Does anyone know how I would best approach it? I'm no expert in python (yet :stuck_out_tongue: ) and I have no idea how to best tackle this"

It's my hope that I can share a little about what I'm trying to do and someone can point me in the right direction. I'm specifically interested to hear about the preferred way to get my code onto the production server (and updated as needed) and what I should be using to run this in production.; This is a very low traffic app that will be hosted locally on a centos box and only accessible on our network. It's a simple web-based UI that take a JSON file as an input and returns a tar file containing 10 or so files (XML, various text files, epub). The code is managed in a git repository."
1264,1553105927.158,Claudine,If it's small and being hosted locally you could probably just install Apache and WSGI_Mod and do it all yourselff
1264,1553105928.1582,Angila,"I've considered just pulling from the repo to get the code on the server, but that doesn't feel like the right call. I've looked into setuptools, but that seems like it's intended to solve a different set of problems."
1264,1553105949.1591,Carlo,to me it actually sounds like the right call
1264,1553105975.1606,Joette,"one simple option: pull into a ""cache"" folder, and copy into a release folder"
1264,1553105981.161,Claudine,yea I'd just clone the repo to the server then point your apache+wsgi_mod at your repo
1264,1553106006.1626,Joette,by using release folders (including updated virtualenvs in each release folder) you can roll back to deployments
1264,1553106009.163,Claudine,"you can `git pull` to update the repo, or hook up some sweet git hooks to do it automatically when your upstream is updated"
1264,1553106016.1633,Carlo,if you feel fancy you could even setup a quick webhook -&gt; git pull on your server down the line; but I wouldnt do much more
1264,1553106020.1637,Joette,with something like Fabric setting it up is close enough to trivial
1264,1553106036.1642,Carlo,"just as <@Claudine> said, git clone and pull as needed feels just fine for something like this"
1264,1553106041.1643,Angila,Thank you. This is all helpful. I get the feeling I've been trying to overcomplicate things
1264,1553106073.165,Carlo,don't we all :wink:
1264,1553106075.1651,Claudine,no problem at all; took me a heck of a time to figure out wsgi_mod when I first started trying to host my own stuff

1264,1553106130.1671,Claudine,in that case you could learn nginx :smile:
1264,1553106142.1677,Angila,funny you mention that…
1264,1553106149.1681,Claudine,"i still haven't tried nginx, I've had to use Apache so much for work that's what I stick with since it's familiar"

1264,1553106180.1692,Angila,prior to posting here my plan was to use nginx as a reverse proxy to hit my app running on gunicorn
1264,1553106232.1697,Carlo,well you _could_ still do that even with the simple git based deploy; probably wont make a noticeable difference in your usecase though
1264,1553106313.1712,Angila,"i initially wanted to use git hooks, but our systems security folks objected. i believe because the repo is outside our network; i think apache and wsgi_mod is what I'm going to do. that way i won't be the only person here who can support it. i do love going on vacation. thanks again!"

1266,1553110376.1763,Carmen,"<@Angila> Just to add another option to your list of ways to do deployment, if you're setting up the copy of code on the server as a git repo, you can add a git remote to your local repo and just push directly to that remote when you want to do a deploy.; If you have a bunch of other things that need to happen when you do a deploy, definitely look into Fabric. But for just pushing out code updates, git push works just fine if your target is also a git repo."
1266,1553110690.179,Angila,<@Carmen> That's an interesting idea about setting up the deployment server as a git remote. I like that. And I'm just taking a look at Fabric. This could get interesting. Thanks!
1266,1553110948.1824,Carmen,"Caveats include: That machine must be reachable from your local machine (otherwise git push won't be able to reach it), others will need to set up the same remote to be able to deploy (not a big deal if you have appropriate documentation), and you somewhat lose out on having the deployed code be a tagged branch (you can tag it, sure, but the remote repo has to be a checkout of a branch that you can push to, like master, not a checkout of a detached head like a tag gives you).; There may be one or two other things that my brain isn't remembering offhand."

1266,1553111142.1855,Angila,"Those first two aren't a problem. And the lack of tagging isn't a deal breaker but it's good to be aware of. I really like that once I've set it up as a remote and others add it, they'd be able to push updates"
1267,1553111169.1861,Wen,i’ve found solution which tell me to put sleep in it but tha won’t help because it’ll stop the execution rather than share it. it’ll just spike back up when it is working.
1267,1553111388.1872,Sasha,"The typical solution there is to set the priority (""nice"" level) of the Python process so the OS will run it only in idle cycles. So, not something that you do within your script itself, but in how you run it."

1267,1553111549.1887,Wen,that could work. if i can find a very easy way to create VMs; thanks. yeah that seems like the most practical solutions so far.

1291,1553228665.2873,Sasha,"So it looks like `symbol[0]` is what you want, and the `'""{}""'.format(symbol[0])` should work. Can you clarify how that broke?"
1291,1553228804.2883,Stacy,"```
for i, v in enumerate(data):
        if i == 0:
            s = 'symbol'
            v.insert(0, s)
            v = "","".join(v)
            print(v)
        elif i &gt; 0:
            symbol = '""{}""'.format(symbol[0])
            v[0] = '""{}""'.format(v[0])

            v = "","".join(v)
            print(v)

The lines look like this, like it's adding an extra quote, or extra empty quotes:

Example lines:

```
"""""",""2019-03-21 14:15:00"",21.0250,21.0250,21.0250,21.0250,211

"""""",""2019-03-21 14:12:00"",21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,621
```"
1291,1553228922.2896,Sasha,"So you seem to be reassigning the `symbol` variable in the line after the `elif`, which means that `symbol[0]` gets to become the quotation mark from `""PVTL""` on subsequent passes through the loop."
1291,1553228957.2899,Stacy,"oh, yeah, here's the top of the output:

```
symbol,timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume

```"
1291,1553228972.2903,Sasha,"So your main problem is variable naming.; Sorry, was that clear enough to indicate how to fix things, or should I be more explicit?"
1291,1553229372.2925,Stacy,"ughhhh. i got it. so this is what I ended up with. so after fixing variable `s` it was the `#v.insert(0, symbol)` line breaking things.

```
            s = '""{}""'.format(symbol[0])
            v[0] = '""{}""'.format(v[0])
            v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])
            #v.insert(0, symbol)

1291,1553229482.2942,Sasha,"Great! By the way, the `v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])` line doesn't do anything in this case, since it's just re-formatting the value as itself."
1291,1553229558.2951,Stacy,"yep, absolutely right.  not sure what that's doing there. haha, only the first two columns need to be quoted in doubles just like this `""PVTL"",""2019-03-21 14:12:00"",21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,621`.  thanks for catching that as well.; made a lot of progress with this today, that was the last problem.  :smile: very much appreciate the assistance."

[('ID', '=', 'Source.ID'),
 ('CreatedAt', '=', 'Source.CreatedAt'),
 ('Note', '=', 'Source.Note')]

Can someone help me with this part?"
1298,1553260815.326,Juliana,This is all getting put into a dict with the teams as keys and the players as the values.
1298,1553261025.3284,Ashley,"<@Juliana> I think this would be a good area to practice OOP. You can make a Team class and a Player class. You can make instances for each team and player, and allow both the player to track what team they're on and the team to track the players on it"
1298,1553261215.3295,Juliana,"I have not gotten to the OOP unit in the class i am taking yet, we are reviewing the concepts learned so far. Is there any way to do it with an if statement? <@Ashley>"

1298,1553261464.3302,Ashley,"I'm not sure you need to; How are the players supposed to be divided up?; Is it to just grab the first 6 and put them on the first team, then grab the next 6 and put them in the next team, and so on?"

1298,1553262830.3396,Ashley,Why would you need an if statement?
1298,1553262986.3399,Juliana,"Because when i run  it like this, it adds it like this {team1 = [all players], team2 = [all players], team3 = [all players]}; this is the way i need it to use later on in the function: {team1 = [1,4,7], team2 = [2,5,8], team3 = [3,6,9,and so on]}; It puts all of the players into each team, it doesn't count them out <@Ashley>"

1298,1553263653.3463,Juliana,right
1298,1553263706.347,Carlo,what <@Ashley> told you actually makes a lot of sense and would be my approach too
1298,1553263728.3478,Juliana,the OOP?
1298,1553263734.3481,Carlo,"nope second solution; &gt; You're basically looking to add them in one by one, until you have no more. You don't need to worry about checking if a team has more than 6 members unless you have more players than 6*number of teams and the assignment says you can only have exactly 6 players; for each player, assign them to the ""next"" team; you basically want to be ""dealing"" players like cards until you don't have any to deal"
1298,1553263908.3515,Juliana,right i know that but i just dont know where or how that snipit of code would work in that fucntion
1298,1553263917.3519,Carlo,right now you're iterating through every team and adding the player
1298,1553263923.3522,Clemmie,This is the situation that enumeration and mod logic are helpful
1298,1553263933.3524,Carlo,"instead of that, just push to one team; <@Clemmie> just gave you a hint of how to keep track of the team you need to push to"
1298,1553263957.3533,Juliana,.enumerate()
1298,1553263959.3534,Clemmie,"you want to loop through players with `count, player = enumerate(players)`; since you know how many team you have `count % teams_count` (or something similar, not looking too close at the code) will give you which team to put a player on; no `enumerate` wraps a list and gives you a tuple of `index, item` in a for loop"
1298,1553264092.3561,Juliana,so i need to take out that second line in the function and replace it or a new line under that
1298,1553264100.3564,Clemmie,"(0 indexed, so take that into account); I would rewrite the function, not try to shoehorn new code into it; you only need one for loop"

```for team, players in teams_with_player_rosters.items():
            players.append(player.get('name'))```; that needs a bit of rethinking"
1298,1553264186.358,Juliana,None; None; Data is getting pulled from another file called constants.py so thats why i have to call on the 'name' <@Carlo> <@Clemmie>
1298,1553264257.3597,Carlo,"that's alright; as <@Clemmie> and I said, that function needs a bit of work, and he basically gave you the logic you have to implement"
1298,1553264322.3614,Clemmie,"<@Juliana> I want to rewrite it for you, but I also want you to understand the concepts we are focusing on"
1298,1553264323.3615,Carlo,"can't speak for him, but I won't write the code for you however, that part is where you learn"
1298,1553264364.3623,Clemmie,we hit on the same feeling at the same time
1298,1553264379.3628,Juliana,right i know thats why im paying alot for this class lol
1298,1553264409.3637,Clemmie,"How about this - I will write you the snippet, but I want you to type back what it is actually doing"
1298,1553264427.3643,Juliana,that works
1298,1553264438.3648,Clemmie,"ok, give me a minute"
1298,1553264465.3657,Juliana,Im just trying to think how that line of code would still call on the data i need; which is 'name'

would be how I'd split it, purely for readability, but maybe that's just me"
1298,1553264881.368,Clemmie,"Yeah, I like one liners - but that is more readable; I grew up on having to allocate everywhere, so If I can get away without a temp var I do"
1298,1553264926.3686,Carlo,hah makes sense!
1298,1553264957.3688,Juliana,So why are devs so intense about only coding few lines and not separating it all out like i had?
1298,1553264986.369,Carlo,hmm because at some point you just get what you're reading and don't _need_ to split it out to understand
1298,1553265029.3693,Clemmie,"Some of it comes from historical language requirements, some about maintainability - it is all logically related to that operation, and I don’t need any of the values there for any other operations"
1298,1553265253.3699,Juliana,Do i need to return anything in that function?
1298,1553265285.3704,Clemmie,"That is a very deep question; For readability you should probably return teams_with_player_rosterss; Strictly speaking, you don’t have to, but that is because dicts are mutable and how python passes parameters - fairly advanced stuff"
1298,1553265402.3712,Juliana,everytime i run the file it has a syntax error at the end of line 2 inside the function
1298,1553265426.3714,Clemmie,that is surely possible - i typed it in textEdit. show me the error?; nm - fixing it in the snippet
1298,1553265466.3719,Juliana,None; None
1298,1553265492.3727,Clemmie,"hmm, can’t edit snippets.; add a `]` before `.append`; and also your return statment at the end"
1298,1553265663.3734,Juliana,So now when it runs it comes out to say 'None'; when printed
1298,1553265675.3738,Clemmie,did you add the return?
1298,1553265685.374,Juliana,yeah

1298,1553266065.3761,Clemmie,Can you add a `print(len(sorted_players))` at the beginning of the method
1298,1553266106.3763,Juliana,18
1298,1553266111.3765,Clemmie,"never mind - I see what is happening; I think; are you still calling `even_teams` twice in `main` (once naked, and once inside a `print` statement)?"
1298,1553266230.3771,Juliana,None; hmmm
1298,1553266304.3781,Clemmie,"Yeah, so you need to be careful calling methods multiple times. dicts are mutable, and like I said earlier son’t _have_ to be returned, so you are adding players to the rosters twice, once with each method call; you need to capture the return of the method call the first time in a var (`teams_with_player_rosters` can be reused) and print that; Still with me?"
1298,1553266581.3787,Juliana,nope haha im trying to figure it out

1298,1553266634.3793,Juliana,both; like what part are you looking at when saying that in the dunder main?
1298,1553266702.3798,Clemmie,"in snippet that you posted you call `even_teams()` in lines 97 and 100; that causes the rosters to be populated twice; but you are appending to lists, so it basically just duplicates the roster; if instead you make line 97 do `teams_with_player_rosters = even_teams(teams_with_player_rosters, sorted_players)` then line 100 can be `print(teams_with_player_rosters)` and the duplication should go away"
1298,1553266924.3806,Juliana,I think you are not refering to the right line numbers so im posting the full app. so i need to change line 90 to that teams = and the line 91 i need to print <@Clemmie>

, sorted_players)1 if you wanted"
1298,1553267104.3818,Juliana,hang on one sec let me digest this and explain in english what is going on
1298,1553267109.382,Clemmie,Great; exactly - don’t worry about the stuff in `main` just tell what `even_teams` is doing
1298,1553267555.3858,Melynda,"I don't know what pyspark is yet (Googling next), but you can do this in plain Python easily: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; [[x, x + 30] for x in range(0, 360, 30)]

1298,1553267656.3869,Juliana,"Ok so <@Clemmie>, line 62 is taking the ` sorted_players ` from a previous function and is parsing through that list of ` sorted_players ` with ` enumerate() ` after that it is then assigning those players with a for loop into teams with open lists from ` teams_with_player_rosters `. It takes the number of teams and `appends ` the players name by grabbing it using the `get()` function."
1298,1553267689.3877,Clemmie,and how does it determine which team to put a player on?
1298,1553267715.3881,Juliana,Although the one thing i feel like im not understanding completely is the use of the ` idx `; I feel like i would be using that to answer the question but im not sure how that part fits in
1298,1553267788.3898,Clemmie,"so `enumerate(&lt;list&gt;)` spits out a tuple for each iteration - the enumeration (position in the list) and the element from the list. so `idx` is the current position in the list (0,1,2,3,4….)"
1298,1553268117.3901,Mora,"If this helps, `idx` is an abbreviation of “index”"

1303,1553273826.4128,Sasha,What kind of thing are A and B?
1303,1553273918.4142,Jolanda,"A and B have attributes like color, size, and shape so I would use these attributes to be able to predict how much % A and B are similar; <@Clemmie> Isn't Edit Distance"

1303,1553274089.4178,Ashley,Nav?
1303,1553274104.4182,Clemmie,They probably built an ML classifier - it generated the algorithm you are looking for; with training sets; and how they wanted the scoring mapping to look
1303,1553274595.4201,Letty,"“similarity metric” might be what you’re looking for (metric there is in the math jargon sense, roughly speaking a “distance formula” but with more rigor); but misthop is right, the “algorithm” is going to be an ML model. Not as scary as it sounds, you could probably follow a `sklearn` tutorial and build a random-forrest classifier quickly (granted, without understanding what’s going on under the hood); if you’re trying to measure the distance between a set of attributes, that’s not ML.; if you’re trying to _guess_ at the probability that some underlying item is similar, based on some known attributes. That’s ML."
1303,1553274931.425,Jolanda,"Exactly <@Clemmie> a Classifier, I have not any experience with ML or Sklearn, but I'll give a try. <@Letty> If a have a tree and a updated tree(the same tree with some changes) with Edit distance I could generate a third tree similar to the update tree using the first?; Anyway <@Clemmie> <@Letty> Thank you guys"

1303,1553275149.4261,Letty,"I’m not quite sure I follow. Edit distance is just going to be a number, telling you how far apart the trees are.

1304,1553277193.4316,Joette,"just be consistent, really; most people's preferences seem to be aesthetic"
1304,1553277225.4327,Jonas,I would use black if it supported single quotes ; Double quotes are... urgh
1304,1553277244.4334,Joette,"I like `""` because I'm used to double quotes indicating strings and single quotes indicating individual characters"
1304,1553277361.4349,Sasha,"I tend to use single quotes for things that are variable/expression-ish, like dict keys, and double quotes for things that are string-ish, like text to be printed. Just personal style, though."

1304,1553277845.4405,Marth,"coming into python I almost always used double quotes, I've noticed I've slowly started to use single quote more often.  For 2 (sorta related?) reasons... 1. aesthetic/looks 'cleaner' to me  2. Using pycharm/VS Code...since it auto adds the second quote (regardless of which I use) I find it easier to see how many quotes are already 'in place' or if I need to click between them to put my cursor there.

1309,1553300869.4735,Sasha,You could consider using the `*args` and `**kwargs` features to pass in multiple arguments from a list/dict. Alternately you could use `functools.partial()` to curry the arguments into your function object.

program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and
try again.`; do i need to download grep? is that a thing that can be downloaded?&gt;"
1327,1553448194.5369,Rebeca,<@Priscilla> are you on windows? i’m guessing you are in windows since `grep` ships with all unix-like OSs

1327,1553448232.5375,Rebeca,":thinking_face:; you might not be able to use that command, since `grep` and `xargs` are shell commands in a linux environment.; but, if the fancy windows “power shell” has those, then go for it."
1327,1553448354.5403,Priscilla,"thats apparently the exact command for windows, according to searching. I wonder if there is a way to install grep, or maybe its meant to be applied through cygwin"

1327,1553449242.5469,Rebeca,it happens all the time.
1327,1553449246.547,Jackie,I've corrected it but I'm still getting the same error
1327,1553449255.5472,Rebeca,"d’oh; `data1={'list_id': 'XXXX',`; is `list_id` an int?"
1327,1553449345.548,Jackie,yes; no ''?

1327,1553449399.5492,Sasha,Missing a trailing quote on the `X-Access-Token` line?; Though that might just be a typo for the XXXXX replacement.

1327,1553449705.5516,Jackie,"no, I guess I could but I don't see why this would not work"
1327,1553449713.5519,Jeanie,"+1 for that; has anyone used twine to create a pip package? mine uploaded fine and i was able to pip install, but when i import it i get “module not found”.. i’m in the same venv i used to install it and it shows up with pip list.."
1327,1553449787.5533,Sasha,"With a quick scan, it looks like the wunderlist API wants a JSON format in the POST body, rather than urlencoded parameters."
1327,1553449814.5536,Rebeca,"<@Jeanie> have used it passingly… one thing to check is whether the `module not found` error is not masking some other error inside your package that you created.
<@Sasha> nice catch!"
1327,1553449934.5561,Jackie,"<@Sasha> Yeah I picked that up a few minutes ago and added the following line to the hdr:
```'Content-Type': 'application/json',```"

1327,1553450231.5586,Sasha,<@Jackie> That might not be sufficient... I'd look into using `json.dumps()` instead of `urlencode()` to create your POST data string.

In the Wunderlist documentation they said that you can add a parameter called ""configuration"" but they have not explained what that is.; is that something generic or something wunderlist specific that they just forgot to document?"

1327,1553453649.5666,Sasha,"<@Jackie> Yeah, I can't see any documentation about that, so my guess is they just have it as a hook for future expansion or something."
1327,1553453667.5668,Jackie,"ok, thanks"
1329,1553454261.5671,Mana,@dd82 
1329,1553454382.5681,Sasha,"You're very close. Have a look at the placement of the `x += 1` statement. Right now it's inside the `if` block, so it only gets executed in the ""not prime"" case."
1329,1553454736.5696,Mana,I tried changing the placement but for everything number I input it returns “it’s not prime”
1329,1553454866.5701,Sasha,Maybe try printing out `x` so you can see what it thinks the number is divisible by.

1329,1553455407.5733,Rodrick,Oh; I think if you change the while-else to an if else it would work
1329,1553455430.5742,Hiroko,"so, I think you have two problems"
1329,1553455433.5744,Rodrick,try that <@Mana>
1329,1553455442.5747,Hiroko,"with your if block, you have the break inside it"
1329,1553455455.5752,Rodrick,oh yea
1329,1553455463.5755,Hiroko,"move the `x += 1 line down and out of that if conditional; eg

```if n % x == 0:
    print(...)
x += 1
```; the `break` inside your `if` check is breaking out of the while loop"
1329,1553455576.5776,Sasha,"The `break` is appropriate here, though, since you don't want to keep checking once you've found a factor."
1329,1553455605.5782,Rodrick,Did that help <@Mana>; my suggestion or anyones?
1329,1553455645.5791,Hiroko,"<@Sasha> not really, IMO.  because the break inside there will stop the loop at the first check if the not a prime hits; here, a while-else is not appropriate, I think; there should be two checks inside the loop"
1329,1553455715.5809,Sasha,"Hmmm, I hate to disagree with you, <@Hiroko>, but I think you might be confused about the math. If you're prime-checking the number 20, you know it's not prime as soon as you see it's divisible by 2."
1329,1553455738.5812,Hiroko,:facepalm: you’re right
1329,1553455750.5816,Rodrick,haha
1329,1553455754.5818,Hiroko,I misread that to check what numbers from 0 to n are prime; not an individual number
1329,1553455771.5823,Sasha,"Ah, gotcha."

- Consider modeling the `MorningstarParser` after the Page Object Model. Instead of `MorningstarParser`  , `MorningstarFundsPage`."

125 ns ± 1 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)

In [14]: %timeit x = []; x.extend(to_extend)
98.5 ns ± 0.464 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)```; extend is better when you are extending anything more than 1 elements; but doing `x.extend([1, 2])` has overhead, as it's allocating a list with two elements and then extending.; So your milage may vary; counter-intuitively, `x.extend(iterable)` can be slower than `x.extend(list(iterable))`; as with the second case the length of the extension is *known* beforehand, whereas with the first it can be any length. So python grows the list dynamically"
1338,1553531912.651,Clemmie,"well, the `list` call has a defined length"
1338,1553531914.6511,Jonas,which has added overhead
1338,1553531939.6513,Clemmie,makes sense
1338,1553531958.6516,Jonas,"to me it doesn't, as you're allocating a list with an unknown length anyway; `list(iterable)` still suffers from the issue, as it's grown dynamically; so `x.extend(list(iterable))` is senseless. But it's faster, so :shrug:"
1338,1553532026.6531,Clemmie,"ah, good point. I’ll have to take a look at the implementation of `extend`.; Its probably simpler that way than having `extend` inspect the type"

1338,1553532775.6557,Clemmie,"Oh, absolutely, just an interesting tidbit to bring out in a code review to annoy people; <@Nenita> it is the difference between `strptime` and `strftime`. The first takes a string and format and makes a date, the other takes a date and spits out the string in the format you asked. If you try your line with `strptime` it should work"
1338,1553532972.6577,Nenita,"f :magic: -&gt; p and it works, but im having to cut the time out of the date and i thought strftime would do that."
1339,1553533039.6593,Melynda,"`strftime` is ""format this date/time instance into a string"", but `strptime` is ""parse this date-like string"". Very un-pythonic naming IMO"

1338,1553533092.6607,Clemmie,"Right, so you need a `strptime` to make it a date object of the format wanted, and then wrap that in a `strftime` to get out the string format you want"

1340,1553537931.6648,Nenita,is there an easy way to shoot back to the start of a loop whilst in the middle of the loop?
1340,1553538038.6654,Sasha,`continue`
1340,1553538042.6656,Marla,you could use `continue` inside of an `if` `else` clause
1340,1553538074.6661,Jorge,you might be able to do this with recursion
1340,1553538141.6669,Marla,"Here’s the difference between `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

1340,1553538405.6676,Nenita,how is continue different than pass?; lol sorry didnt read the other comments; thanks <@Marla>
1340,1553538484.669,Sasha,`continue` immediately jumps to the next loop iteration. `pass` does nothing. It's essentially a blank line for situations where a blank line isn't allowed.

1341,1553548088.6801,Freeda,Ah I see... so I missed a layer

1341,1553548315.6842,Jorge,"you've got the right idea with your code.
you just have to check and make sure how you traverse it.
some of this data is in a list, some of it is  python dicts/json objects"
1341,1553548337.6847,Freeda,That's annoying; so should I be converting it all to lists as I go?
1341,1553548349.6853,Jorge,you'll probably run into some KeyErrors/TypErrors
1341,1553548366.686,Freeda,Yeah I was hitting those before I started over again haha

1341,1553548435.6871,Jorge,interesting...*splits* for each team is a list
1341,1553548469.6875,Freeda,"yeah I really dont like that part; idk how ill tackle that; Ok, so this seems like a better start, right?"
1341,1553548554.6889,Hiroko,<https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi>; check that out
1341,1553548596.6897,Freeda,"Yeah, he's just explaining the links though; right?; how do I get all the way down to the two splits from TeamStats?  there are so many levels and it looks like splits and teamStats are lists and the rest dicts"
1341,1553548915.692,Jorge,"yea, this is all it says about the teams data:
```
Teams
GET <https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams> Returns a list of data about
all teams including their id, venue details, division, conference and franchise information.
```

say if you wanted to get the best team in hockeys wins, you'd do this:
```
NHLTeamsData['teams'][18]['teamStats'][0]['splits'][0]['stat']['wins']
```; if you wanted to get the best team's name, you'd do this:
```
NHLTeamsData['teams'][18]['name']
```"
1341,1553549104.6927,Freeda,"getting a KeyError on teamStats, must be the list vs dict thing"
1342,1553549205.6945,Deon,its not
1341,1553549219.695,Deon,i think its NHLTeamsData['teamStats']['splits']
1341,1553549230.6955,Freeda,Ahh I can truncate it like that??
1341,1553549231.6956,Jorge,"in this part:
```
    for stat in NHLTeamsData['teamStats']:
        for split in NHLTeamsData['splits']:
            for stat in NHLTeamsData['stat']:
                gamesPlayed = stat['gamesPlayed']
```
you're traversing that a bit wrong

essentially that creates for loops over keys that dont exist on the root dict
what you want is this:
```
    for stat in team['teamStats']:
        for split in stat:
            for stat in split['stat']:
                gamesPlayed = stat['gamesPlayed']

1345,1553573402.7158,Candra,I'm unsure let me see; Yeah so the space is messing it up
1345,1553573455.7169,Sasha,"The `\S` means a non-space character, I think. If you want to capture anything, use a period."

1345,1553573567.7188,Sasha,"Ah, then maybe you do want to truncate on spaces.; Note that `match()` implies a match at the start of the string, too. `search()` will look everywhere for it."
1345,1553573699.7196,Candra,Okay thank you for the tip.; Does it have a max length that it will match by default?
1345,1553573866.7207,Sasha,Not to my knowledge.

1345,1553573919.7215,Sasha,"That's weird. Can you give some examples, and the regex you're using?"

1345,1553574967.7357,Sasha,"Sorry, let me explain. The `(.+)` is going to match as many characters as possible, including spaces, and THEN will try to match the `\b`, which would be at the end of the string.

The result is the “probability” that the skewness of your distribution is different to a normal one. In general be really careful with these type of statistics because you might want to decide a threshold (e.g. `pvalue &lt; 0.05`) in order to determine whether the moment is similar enough.

Paired with the t-test on the mean, standard deviation and kurtosis, these statistics can give you an indication on whether the distribution you are dealing with can be treated as normal. Take everything I said with a grain of salt, it is a gross approximation and you should look into a more theoretically precise definition.

Please find screenshot below

Why it showing any results. Pytest html gets generated properly"
1369,1553709266.8434,Johna,whoa what is that? i just see the terminal output when i run pytest
1365,1553709791.8437,Hiroko,<http://allure.qatools.ru/>; looks to be that
1368,1553710568.8448,Ashley,"<@Merlyn> that's a pretty platform-specific question, so you might not be able to get much help here. But I can take a whack at it; normally when you have a system like this, it doesn't actually care about the html report. Instead, it relies on some other output, like the JUnit XML output; that gives it a uniform, standardized format that can be easily ingested and parsed; There could, however, be a pytest plugin in play that knows how to submit the results as they come in into some other system, like a DB that your allure system is pulling from (or it's the system that the results are being pumped into); I would first make sure you have your tests running properly. If they're outputting to an HTML file, they might not be outputting to the digestible system that allure depends on"
1368,1553710799.8515,Merlyn,Pytest generated lots of files some json and other format but using that files it should generate results as per docs but it's not showing tests in report
1368,1553710831.8518,Ashley,are you sure it's still generating those files?
1368,1553710842.852,Merlyn,Yes

1372,1553727145.8824,Hiroko,how did you add this thing?; did you do it in the terminal or write to file?
1372,1553727194.8833,Kristine,"Yeah if you did it in an external editor, you may have messed up the permissions."
1372,1553727256.8838,Hiroko,or if you just did it in the terminal it won’t stick
1372,1553727277.884,Kristine,"Oh yeah, that too.; You should be putting that line in .bash_profile in your user directory really."
1372,1553727300.8847,Jordon,hmm okay
1372,1553727314.885,Kristine,"If you have that there, and it’s not working, try chowning it, and chmod u+rwxing it"
1372,1553727341.8852,Hiroko,"but before you do that; would help to know exactly what you did <@Jordon>; what file, what command, etc"
1372,1553727419.887,Jordon,bashrc wasn’t working; nice it works; i clearly dont know the difference; i stuck i in bash_profile and it worked; my msgs are out of order due to wifi problems…
1372,1553727434.8879,Kristine,"Yeah, you can share that easily with the tail of .bash_history in your user directory, just be sure to censor any passwords you may have typed as command line arguments anywhere.; Oh well you got it working at least."
1372,1553727488.8883,Jordon,thanks for the help everyone!; much appreciated
1372,1553727581.8895,Kristine,"Yeah, .bashrc didn’t work because on OSX, when you run <http://Terminal.app|Terminal.app>, it creates a login-shell in each new terminal window instead of a non-login shell like you would normally experience on Linux. .bashrc is for non-login shells, and .bash_profile is for login shells"
1372,1553727620.8897,Hiroko,does that also apply to iterm2?
1372,1553727628.8901,Kristine,"I believe so, yes."
1372,1553727633.8905,Hiroko,gotcha.
1372,1553727668.8911,Kristine,"I use iterm2, but I haven’t actually paid close enough attention. Probably has an option somewhere to disable that behavior given how much freedom it gives us.; Absolutely a gem of a program."
1372,1553727709.8919,Jordon,i should start using it; everyone at work uses it; im on the default terminal
1372,1553727746.8928,Kristine,"One solution if you’re really used to using .bashrc from working on linux so much is to add
```if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi```
to your .bash_profile; that way you could even share a .bashrc file across multiple linux and mac machines, and not have to worry about it not functioning properly on the macs, or having to echo the changes across to your .bash_profile every time"

1374,1553737416.8976,Hiroko,"I’m not sure how it would be useful?; requires you to write the json definition first, where you could be spending that time writing the code itself"
1374,1553737701.9003,Stacy,"yeah so i just provided it json output from an API, so i'm not sure if the code being generated is to ultimately be able to parse/use the json output more efficiently moving forward or something, if you were to save the json output to a file, read it in using python then leveraging the python generated code or something.  no idea."
1374,1553738039.901,Kristine,Maybe it’s more useful for schema and/or GraphQL? I don’t know those personally so I can’t speak for the practicality of using it for those.

1376,1553758370.005,Valeri,What do you mean by: `I'd then proxy the API requests to Django servers..`?; There's a javascript server serving frontend reqs and a django server serving backend requests arising from the frontend?; Is that what you wish to do?
1376,1553758448.0073,Cathi,"Node will run on specific ports and Django on its own. So users will request the node server. If it is API request, then I'll forward that to Django endpoints from node's, that'll need proxy.; Yes"
1376,1553758519.0086,Valeri,Aah basically a react/vue frontend and a django backend is what you're trying to do?
1376,1553758562.0088,Cathi,"Yes exactly.; I've not done anything like that before, just served monoliths..; Heard that nodejs could handle large number of requests whereas my Django server could crash.

1383,1553783559.0747,Florencio,no issue with this; I just want to check if this particular `id` in `message` exist in `tansaction`; that's why I used `get` for transaction cos the `id` is supposed to be once

1383,1553783777.0774,Florencio,transaction has a column 'message' that is a foreignkey

1383,1553785011.0815,Hiroko,"<@Florencio> if you want help, providing details is pretty important; for example your query above, providing said exception info would be a key part in figuring the solution"

1383,1553785919.0871,Dawn,ah like that. but i do need a datetime object because i'm sending it to an odbc; that's becoming a mess..
1383,1553786008.0882,Florencio,okay; I'll do that; None
1384,1553786378.0911,Hiroko,what is `id` in this context?; you don’t specify it at all
1383,1553786410.0922,Hiroko,"line 16 is the first time it shows up, hasn’t been declared anywhere else"
1383,1553786444.0924,Dawn,"any fast way to convert from pendulum back to datetime object? the only example i could find is
```
if isinstance(value, pendulum.Pendulum):
            value = datetime.datetime(

                value.second, value.microsecond, value.tzinfo
            )
```
that's a real detour; and even that doesn't work as wanted, i just want a naive datetime as output, without the timezone explicitly included"
1384,1553786652.0935,Clemmie,Why are you using pendulum?
1383,1553786675.094,Dawn,"to convert to another timezone?; don't know any other way to do that; the use case is:
i have a datetime object with UTC timezone
i want to convert it to CET timezone
output should still be a datetime object because a database is going to handle it"
1383,1553786732.0958,Clemmie,do you need pendulum for anything else? if not you should probably use the `pytz` package (python timezone)
1383,1553786780.0963,Dawn,"i use it in other places to set the current time, but can use both; as long as it fixes my problems :upside_down_face:"
1383,1553786832.0978,Clemmie,"it should, it is basically for editing timezone info on python datetime objects"
1383,1553786859.0989,Florencio,<@Hiroko> id is supposed to be msg_list.id; but rn I don't even know what to think; I should prolly take coffee

Thanks!"
1383,1553787533.1093,Florencio,<@Clemmie> I only want to work with id
1383,1553787583.11,Clemmie,"can you describe what you are trying to do in words - your code doesn’t make a huge amount of sense to me; I understand what it is trying to do, but what it is trying to do is confusing"
1383,1553787666.1107,Florencio,"okay i'll try; i have lets say 4 different request for different products; this method shows only the ones I accepted; in the ones accepted, they're some I have attended to and others I'm yet to; the ones I've attended to, their Ids are saved in `Transaction` table"
1383,1553787807.114,Clemmie,"I get that - but the code seems to care about returning the accepted messages, where it seems to me you want to return the list of transactions whose messages were accepted"
1383,1553787883.1148,Florencio,okay
1383,1553787891.1153,Clemmie,am i correct?; or not
1383,1553787917.1161,Florencio,but not all Accepted Messages are in Transaction; That's why I just go with if it is Accepted and also have it's Id in Transaction
1383,1553787980.1173,Clemmie,"Do you need all accepted messages, or only accepted messages that are also in a transaction?; Or all accepted messages, and whether they are in a transaction or not"
1383,1553788123.1182,Florencio,"yeah all Accepted messages that are in Transaction  will have `tick = ""ok""`; else `tick = """"`"
1383,1553788208.1193,Clemmie,"so all accepted messages, with tick ok for those in a transaction"
1383,1553788237.1195,Florencio,yeah; that's it
1383,1553788495.123,Clemmie,"Ok, so now put that into code. In particular you are not iterating through the message list to check if each message is in a transaction (and you will need to use `filter()` in the lookup, not `get()` as by you model a message can be in more than one transaction. You will probably also want to put them into a dict like `{'ok':[&lt;list of messages&gt;'], 'not':[&lt;list_of_messages&gt;]}`"
1383,1553788619.1232,Florencio,"wow; i'll try to understand what you mean; i think i'll just leave this; cos in my head it should be simple, but when i try to implement it, it's something else; I'll make the field unique so that I dont have the same request twice in `Transaction`"
1383,1553789229.1265,Clemmie,You can also make it a OneToOne - it sounds like that is somewhat more correct for your use case
1383,1553789266.1268,Florencio,but it's Foreignkey
1383,1553789278.127,Clemmie,Is this a production system?

1383,1553789290.1274,Clemmie,"oh, ok"
1383,1553789370.1279,Florencio,"that's why I wanted to differentiate them by `ticks`; so that I know while going through the list of all `Accepted` requests, I could see the ones with the `ticks`"

1388,1553797309.1339,Carmen,"<@Deon> Sorry for the delay on replying to this.; So what you're doing is setting up a full git repo copy of your code on your server and serving from that directory.; Then you can use the built-in git remote functionality to push code to that remote production repo with a simple `git push production master`; Assuming, of course, that you've named the remote `production` and you're serving up the `master` branch.; If you're serving from gunicorn, however, I'd recommend that you wrap the push deployment process inside another script (such as a Fabric fabfile) and have it restart gunicorn automatically once it's pushed the code to the production git remote."

The reason being that `unittest.TestCase` has its own test running logic that would break if pytest tried to mess with it. So to be safe, they just have pytest treat those kinds of classes as they would normally be treated, which means you can't have things like fixtures."

1404,1553874638.2388,Claudine,"needs? nah, it's just a common construct"
1404,1553875026.2418,Genesis,"<@Clemmie> is has nothing to do with dynamic typing. Its moreso the confusion around the `break` statement inside switch statements.  Switch statements have a ""feature"" where they passthrough to the next statement unless you use break. There are very few scenarios where this is actually needed, and it mostly is confusing to begginers and a lot of people don't understand that feature. So python, which is supposed to be easier to parse for begginers, just doesn't support it. Forces you to write your code in a way thats easier to understand"
1404,1553875209.2437,Clemmie,"Do you have a citation for that? I’m not saying you are wrong, but the reasonings I can find - In the docs: do it with `if elif else` “There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.” and in the pep noted in the docs - 275 there is a throwaway line that speaks to the issue with dynamic typing `Note that the constants need not be all of the same type, but they should be comparable to the type of the switch variable.`; I also don’t know about “easier to parse for beginners” there are plenty of operators and reserved words in the standard lib that are barely comprehensible by experts. I mean `:=` was accepted for 3.8"

Following from the thought that `break` is often forgotten, `match` assumes each case breaks unless an explicit `continue` is encountered."
1404,1553875382.2484,Clemmie,"It is a good beginner language because you don’t _need_ to use these features, but I don’t think there is any motivating factor to keep python easy for beginners. More don’t add functionality if it can be easily handled in an already existing way"

1407,1553879058.2609,Jonas,sounds like a requirement you don't want; how about just list the files you want to search; and use `glob.glob()` on the filenames; `[filename for filename in files_i_can_list if glob.matches(filename)]`...
1407,1553879163.2645,Tyson,You mean like `os.chroot`? I was hoping for a more easy solution.

1412,1553891101.3071,Freeda,None; It must be in the parameters/what I'm attempting to pass into the function; If I can get some help with this I should be able to figure out my remaining functions as the core idea of them are very similar
1413,1553893083.3095,Kelley,"can you describe the issue? is there an error/stacktrace, specific outputs that you're expecting vs actually getting"
1412,1553893901.31,Freeda,"None; And it's just not doing the function.  The purpose is to evaluate a few columns against each other and output the result in a new column within the dataframe.  The columns to be evaluated are; team_home_score, team_away_score, ou_total which will decide what happens with ou_units and ou_line.  The return of ou_units and ou_line will be in the new column ou_pnl; I'm just not good at functions so I feel like I'm doing something wrong with the setup"
1412,1553894069.3127,Jorge,can you post the stacktrace?
1412,1553894099.3135,Freeda,what's a stacktrace?
1412,1553894198.3153,Jorge,"when your program fails, it will print out the last 5 or so lines that were run, including the file locations + functions
the last line will have the specific error/exception that caused your program to fail"
1412,1553894234.3161,Freeda,gotcha; now i'm just getting that indentation error
1412,1553894253.3168,Jorge,"if its an indentation error, you should just check to make sure your code is formatted correctly.
1 tab or 4 spaces for each line, each ""block"" of code gets another 4 spaces/1 tab"
1412,1553894382.3175,Freeda,"AGH; I commented a line under a with above the function; whoops; Okay, back at the ValueError; think it's because there are zeros in the column?; it says 'occurred at index 0', first line is a zero, maybe that's the cause"
1414,1553894743.3205,Raguel,can you share sample data?
1412,1553894745.3206,Freeda,Should I set zeros to np.nan? or maybe there's an exception to fix this error; This is the column I want to apply the function to
1412,1553895095.3217,Raguel,"I believe it is throwing error because of this line `if df[df['overunder'].str.contains('u')]:` as this line returns a whole dataframe, and if statement doesn't know what to evaluate it to"
1414,1553895135.3225,Raguel,your `if` statement needs to evaluate to some `boolean` form here
1414,1553895392.3226,Carmen,This link should give you a solid grasp of what I mean with git remotes. <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes>
1412,1553895434.3232,Freeda,I had a hunch that may be it so I removed the outside df[ ] wrapper but it didnt work; threw the same error... wouldn't df['overunder'] just return that column?; So this is what I have now...
1414,1553895915.3252,Carmen,"And this is actually a great tutorial on setting up everything I meant (with a little extra): <https://gist.github.com/Nilpo/8ed5e44be00d6cf21f22>; I don't do the separate git working directory with the post-receive hook that does a checkout, but that's actually a great way to avoid exposing your `.git` directory accidentally."
1414,1553895975.326,Kelley,There should be multiple lines above the ValueError you pasted which I hope points to the exact line where the error occurred
1412,1553896087.3272,Kelley,"Also, based on the fact that you don't use the `row` argument anywhere in the function, I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of `df.apply`"
1414,1553896188.3279,Kelley,maybe you actually want to do `df['ou_pnl'] = evaluate_overunder(df)`
1412,1553896253.3285,Kelley,either that or you should be referencing `row` somewhere in the function

1417,1553929347.3656,Sasha,"Weird. From a language perspective, Python should only care that an indented block is self-aligned and indented ""more"" than the enclosing block. So anything from 1 space and up ought to be allowed."

1435,1554044424.4464,Beckie,"Hi friends, I have two doubts
1) I need help in python package making.
Basically, there's a repo on github written in python and cython.
Currently, it requires cloning, installing gcc and python dependencies to build and run it which is not easy way for new inexperienced users.
I want to make a python package so that it will have a common installation procedure on all platforms(windows, linux)
$ pip install &lt;package&gt;
will it possible considering it requires gcc to build.

2) To help the new users (considering it requires installing gcc and many things which have different installation procedure depending on platforms), I am also looking to make a standalone package to ship and came across PyInstaller. Will it work considering it requires something to pack that doesn't belongs to python(gcc)."

Maybe CSV if you have that export option from your data source.; If the data is more varied and doesn't have a repeating structure, I'd recommend either a YAML file or a JSON file.; YAML is easier in my experience to build by hand, JSON is more common if you have an export option with your data source."
1435,1554046441.4526,Sasha,"Or if you're stuck in Python 2, you just need to parenthesize `(turn + 1)` so the addition happens before the string conversion. Alternately, you can change the `range()` to start with 1 instead of 0."

I have a rather simple (view) decorator which looks something like below:

```

        app = request.auth.application

Nest into properties twice:

`shirt_size = shirt_properties.get('size')`

Or is there no difference?"
1446,1554122784.5268,Clemmie,"<@Dawn> a couple of answers - the latter might be ever so slightly more performant, as you are accessing `properties` only once. In this use case it is minimal, but with larger or deeper data it could impact you.  I would also be wary about missing keys - it can be handled in both of these cases, but they lend themselves to being handled differently - in the first case to `shirt.get('properties', {}).get('color',None)` the second more to wrapping the properties in a `try....except KeyError` and then not bothering to look up color and size, just setting them to None."
1448,1554122977.529,Shawana,"Hey,

I'm trying to create a github repo via cli inside python on windows with `subprocess.call(f'curl <https://api.github.com/user/repos?access_token={TOKEN}> -d ""{{\""name\"": \""{NEW}\"", \""private\"": {str(PRIVATE).lower()}}}""', shell=True)`

what I get back:
```

  ""message"": ""Problems parsing JSON"",
  ""documentation_url"": ""<https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create>""

Any ideas? In my point of view I followed the instructions in `<https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create>` detail ;-("
1446,1554123047.5297,Dawn,Thanks. Yeah i'm using this for ETL so i'll go for the more performant one. Using the replacement empty dict and None for the end value should be enough right?
1446,1554123078.5304,Clemmie,"can you get that subprocess to print what it is calling? then you can debug the curl by hand and backpropagate to the correct call; Should be, if getting None for your terminal value when the intermediate key is missing is the correct behavior"
1446,1554123163.5311,Shawana,"it's calling : `curl <https://api.github.com/user/repos?access_token=&lt;m_token&gt;> -d ""{""name"": ""TESTPROJECT"", ""private"": true}""`"

1446,1554123229.5322,Clemmie,I’m guessing is it a problem with quotes - that looks odd to me for some reason; :thumbsup:

Yes. `subprocess.call(f'curl <https://api.github.com/user/repos?access_token={TOKEN}> -d ""{{\\""name\\"": \\""{NEW}\\"", \\""private\\"": {str(PRIVATE).lower()}}}""', shell=True)` works.. the curl had to be called escaped too, not only the python string :open_mouth:; <@Clemmie> :taco:"
1446,1554123929.534,Melynda,"Shelling out to curl seems a bit weird – why not just make the HTTP call from Python?; If you must use `subprocess`, you might be better off passing `args` as ""a sequence of program arguments"" rather than fighting shell parsing semantics, too. `subprocess.call(['curl', url, '-d', json_data])` might work.; &gt; Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments."

1449,1554125826.5399,Claudine,"Running into an annoying AWS API Gateway issue where they are transforming my XML response and it's killing my stuff.

the first character is  `{`, so that will match your opening curly brace
this is followed by a character group `[]`, but those `[` `]` have things inside them
the things inside are `^}`, inside a character group `^` is a negation and `}` is the character being negating, so this character group matches any character that is not a `}` (including newlines)
and then we have `*` at the end, which means match as many of the previous negation as possible; then eventually we hit your closing `}` which terminations the previous matchy bit there; so like `[a]` will match one lower case `a` [^a]` will match anything that isn't a lowercase `a`"

in weird cases i have also seen `\m` which is damn near invisible unless you view it on terminal lol and has been known to throw wrenches on occasion :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
1462,1554168505.0595,Stacy,"Hello.  I have a list that contains data like this:

```
[{'broker': 0, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 1, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]
[{'broker': 1, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 2, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]
[{'broker': 2, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 0, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]
```
That data above is generated by this:  `broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]`

My output code is like so:

```
lc_partitions = [ p['partition'] for p in output['partitions'] ]
lc_leader = [ l['leader'] for l in output['partitions'] ]
lc_replicas = [ r['replicas'] for r in output['partitions'] ]

for i in range(slice):
    print(i)
    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]

    for lc_p,lc_l,b,l,i in zip(lc_partitions, lc_leader, broker, leader, in_sync):
        print('Partitions: Partition - {0} Leader - {1} Replicas: Broker - {2} Leader - {3} In_Sync - {4}'.format(lc_p, lc_l, b, l, i))
```

The issue is that it prints the formatted data for each loop, when I only want to print part of the output once, and concatenate/zip/? the replica data (which requires the looping, at least how I'm doing it currently) to each Partitions line.  So it currently does this:

```
0 #loop count
Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - True In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - True In_Sync - True
```

```
1 #loop
Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - False In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - False In_Sync - True
```

I want the lines to look like this:

`Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True`
`Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 2 Leader - False In_Sync - True`
`Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 0 Leader - False In_Sync - True`

Hopefully this makes sense."
1460,1554179885.0614,Sasha,"It's not completely clear what you want. What data should be associated with partition 0? From the example, it looks like you just want the two broker entries in the first entry of the replicas list. So I'm not sure why you're trying to zip across records."
1462,1554180430.0658,Stacy,"<@Sasha> so the lines that i want it to look like combine sections of both loop 0 and loop1 because `lc_replicas` contains two dictionaries within one list, so I have to loop through those keys with these:

```
    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]
```
I'm doing this because I believe these show the results of partitions that have 2 replicas - it could be 1 to 3 so I'm trying to take that into account, in which case the line i want it to look like could potentially be  `Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True, ****Broker - 2, Leader - False, In_Sync - True****` where the third loop adds the content contained within asterisks.  Does that help?  Without the loops the output would simply be `Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0` which requires no loops, just a matter of zipping the results together so they match up.; I basically want to concat the content from the loops of the dictionaries together so they're contained on the same line when I zip everything together."
1462,1554180546.0668,Sasha,From your original list:
1462,1554180558.0673,Stacy,"i'm not sure if leveraging itertools / chain would help in this case.  haven't used it before.; so there's a total of 47 partitions total (contained within `lc_partitions = [ p['partition'] for p in output['partitions'] ]` - i only need to loop those once.  the way the current code works is it adds the replicas details to the partitions in two separate loops because i'm looping broker/leader/in_sync list comprehensions twice in this example....it could potentially be 1-3.  so in the snippets where it shows `#loop 0`, it goes from 0 to 47, with the first slice/element of dictionaries in the list :

```
    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]
```

loop 1 then goes through partitions 0-47 again, appending the second element of the list. i want both `x[0]['broker'],x[0]['leader'],x[0]['in_sync'] and x[1]['broker'],x[1]['leader'],x[1]['in_sync']` printed on the same line."
1462,1554181068.0735,Sasha,"Let me sketch out what I think you want, and you correct me... Give me a sec."
1462,1554181152.0747,Stacy,"i'm probably complicating by just doing snippets vs the whole thing, i can try to provide more if that would help"
1462,1554181304.0748,Sasha,"I think you just want a nested loop like this, if I understand which data you want where.; Doesn't do the commas correctly, but meh, you get the idea."
1462,1554181623.0759,Stacy,"Yes!!!!!; Ok, so this strips out the need of me needing to my slice logic to take into account how many dictionaries there might be in the replicas because well....it's already provided.  That's apparent now; i knew at some point i'd have to end with a space in attempt to concat the two lines together also.  i had this commented out from previous troubleshooting `#print(lc_p, lc_l, l, b, i, end=' ')`; my confusion was how to iterate those dictionaries within the replicas list.; this is great.  thank you <@Sasha> at some point i'm going to have to buy you beers instead of tacos (if you're in to that.)  :slightly_smiling_face:"
1462,1554181924.0793,Sasha,"Heh, no problem. Happy to help, and glad it wasn't as complicated as it seemed."
1462,1554181989.08,Stacy,still getting a hang of python data structures.  i always seem to over complicate it and have to strip things down.. need to quit making things so hard.; can't wait till rhel8 when i can start using f-strings all the time.  using .format to be compatible on my servers for now.
1463,1554182313.0813,Demetrice,"Oh hey <@Sasha> I'm trying to understand a problem conceptually, could we talk through it?"
1462,1554182357.0816,Sasha,"Sure, go for it."
1462,1554182426.0821,Demetrice,So i'm trying to help a friend with a coding challenge. and i realized that i can't quite conceptualize it myself; None; So i first i thought it would just be a series of if statements and that would be simple enough. But then i realized it will probably incorporate some concepts i'm not familiar with; I mean i don't actually have to write it. Just conceptualizing it successfully is the goal.; If it's too long to read i can do a tl;dr
1462,1554182803.0868,Sasha,"I understand the problem, but it's not immediately obvious how to solve it. My first point of slight confusion is even to figure out what the brackets look like for tournaments that don't have a power-of-two number of teams, since some teams will have to skip a round, and maybe we want our favored team to do that."
1462,1554182879.0883,Demetrice,I thought the implication was that there's any number of teams; but i don't think odd numbers are allowed. I think it has to be a logical bracket
1462,1554182895.089,Sasha,"For our team to advance to a slot in the bracket, it will have to be the highest-ranked team in that subtree, but the exact ordering of other teams doesn't matter within that tree."
1462,1554182902.0893,Demetrice,"I mean that's an assumption, but i don't know how that wouldn't be the case; Ohh you're right; You know i've been trying to make the bracket from the bottom up; But i think just &gt; statements might work?; I'm not sure; No it's not that easy. Hmm"
1462,1554183176.0938,Sasha,"Waaaait... in the pasted text, it says ""2N"" teams. Is that actually ""2^N"" with an exponent?"
1462,1554183188.094,Demetrice,So i was thinking and i'm not sure if this makes sense but i was thinking we'd want to try to sort it top to bottom x number of times; Yeah it pastes 2N but it's actually 2^N
1462,1554183296.0948,Sasha,"Okay, that's much easier, so we have a complete tree, with no skipped rounds."
1462,1554183333.0955,Demetrice,I can't tell if it's easy or hard. Would we want to try to sort it? How would you approach this?
1462,1554183396.0968,Sasha,"We know that if our team is the lowest ranked, it wins 0 rounds. If there is at least 1 lower-ranked team, it wins 1 round. If there are 3 lower-ranked teams, it can win 2 rounds. If there are 7 lower-ranked teams, it can win 3 rounds, etc."
1462,1554183420.0973,Demetrice,"Okay, i didn't think of it in that way"
1462,1554183468.0981,Sasha,"So all you have to do is put our team in the first slot, put all the lower-ranked teams in the next slots, and then fill the rest with the higher-ranked teams."
1462,1554183499.0984,Demetrice,Huh; Yeah i mean that makes sense conceptually; Wait no that actually makes sense; So you just arrange the teams in order of weakest to strongest; Place are team in the first slot and then fill out the bracket?; *** our
1462,1554183681.1013,Sasha,"Yep, that seems to be a sufficient solution. The code would basically just be a print loop with an if or two."
1462,1554183732.1021,Demetrice,So we're just ordering the teams from weakest to strongest. bumping ours to the front slot and then printing the result?; That's it?
1462,1554183770.1028,Sasha,"Pretty much, yep. Unless someone sees something we're missing about the problem."
1462,1554183830.1032,Demetrice,My friend asks what if we wanted to make the bracket random; Which isn't actually a requirement but would probably make it significantly harder
1462,1554183875.104,Sasha,"I don't quite understand. If it's random, we don't have any choice."
1462,1554183957.1042,Demetrice,"Well maybe not random; But not as ordered as our team, weakest -&gt; strongest; Not random i guess just disorganized. to mimic an actual bracket"
1462,1554184149.1063,Sasha,"You can definitely scramble up the teams and still get the same result, as long as there are at least 2^m - 1 weaker teams in our team's tree (for winning m rounds)."
1462,1554184202.1067,Demetrice,"Okay, i think i understand the simple solution pretty well conceptually; But i wouldn't know how to conceptualize how to solve a the problem to get the scrambled version; That would be significantly harder, right?"
1462,1554184346.1088,Sasha,"Not necessarily. Step 1 would be to figure out how many rounds your team is supposed to win. Then you can fill out his nearby bracket with any random choice of 2^m - 1 out of the weaker teams. And then fill the rest of the brackets randomly from whoever is left, stronger or weaker."
1462,1554184461.1098,Demetrice,I think i'm almost there. I'm just struggling conceptualizing it because it scales so hard; if there's 100 rounds and we're supposed to win 40; Then that would be err a lot of local brackets to fill out; Maybe there's a simple way to account for that that i'm not thinking of
1462,1554184581.1118,Sasha,"Well, there's no way around that if you have 100 rounds... that's 2^100, or about 10^30, a really astronomical-sized tournament."
1462,1554184645.1122,Demetrice,lol somehow a tournament with more team's that humans on the planet; Maybe it's a universal tournament; Okay so maybe not 100 but say there's 10; and we're supposed to win 8
1462,1554184671.1132,Sasha,"""Pick the best atom on the planet!"""
1462,1554184678.1134,Demetrice,"lol; That's 64 ""local"" Teams to assign; as opposed to another example when there's only 2 if we're only winning one game; How do i account for that level of variance. The more i think about it the more i think there's probably a pretty easy way to write it."
1462,1554184767.1158,Sasha,"Yep. The more rounds you want to ""fix"", the more control you have to have over the brackets. But the problem as stated has you printing out all the brackets anyway, so it's the same amount of work either way, more or less."
1462,1554184836.1165,Demetrice,So when i know how many rounds our team should be winning just need put that many teams in the first x spaces and then randomize it? I suppose; So if we're winning 3 rounds i'm only concerning myself with the first 8 entries and so on and so forth; There's a lot of this that i can't write but i think i understand it for the most part now
1462,1554184882.1174,Sasha,Yep
1462,1554184922.1184,Demetrice,:taco: <@Sasha> Make that a mega Taco
1462,1554184924.1186,Sasha,"And if there are, say, 12 lower-ranked teams, you can pick any 7 of them."
1462,1554184936.119,Demetrice,"I don't know why you never sleep, but i'm not complaining about it"
1462,1554184976.1196,Sasha,"Heh, I do, but I'm a couple of time-zones westward, so it's not as late here."
1464,1554186614.1202,Demetrice,You know i think i'm going to try to write it. I'm curious
1462,1554186617.1204,Demetrice,At least the simple version anyway
1464,1554188887.1208,Demetrice,So how does this look so far; None; <@Sasha> I'm not sure if you're still around. But i think i just need help on the last step
1464,1554190209.1234,Sasha,"Cool, I like the remove-and-append, very elegant. For the last step you just need to print them out in pairs. One easy way to do that would be to use `range()` with a step size of 2."
1464,1554190308.1238,Demetrice,Trying to figure out how to print it in pairs has me stumped; Wait; It's a for statement and i'm leveraging the range function taking 3 parameters. But i can't put it all together in my head
1464,1554190467.1259,Sasha,"I'll give you a hint. You want to print out Teams[0]-Teams[1], then Teams[2]-Teams[3], etc. So if the range is giving you 0, 2, 4, etc..."
1464,1554190509.1269,Maegan,"<@Demetrice> this should help you out, in a loop mention the start and end bound and you should have multiple lists that can be `join()`ed with a `-`

1464,1554190535.1271,Demetrice,I tried This. Which was wrong. I'm sure this is simple but it's 2:30 am. Just give me a sec
1464,1554190553.1275,Maegan,seems  it is your homework?
1464,1554190585.1281,Demetrice,No it's not homework. I was initially just doing research for a friend. But now i just want to complete it for pride; My brain hurts. This shouldn't be so difficult
1464,1554191371.1305,Russ,"Given that `l = [%your_list_from_#random_channel%]` this would print elements in pairs:
```
for elem in range(1, len(l), 2):
    print(f'{elem}-{l[l.index(elem) + 1]}')
```
Note that you need to sort the list first, otherwise you'll have `7-9` and then `9-10`; But I feel that's some kind of hack and it will break easily..."
1464,1554191572.1314,Sasha,"Yeah, there's some back-story to the list indicating why you don't want to sort it."
1464,1554191623.1322,Demetrice,I don't know if i'm missing something obvious or if this is legitimately hard. But it i just applied and if statement and used the range properly this would be done
1464,1554191711.1338,Sasha,"Here's another hint... if you wanted to print out ""10-11, 20-21, 30-31"" and I gave you 10, 20, 30 from the range() function, how would you attack that?"
1464,1554191810.135,Russ,"How about this?
```
for idx, elem in enumerate(l):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        print(f'{elem}-{l[idx+1]}')

1464,1554192028.1354,Sasha,"That would work, <@Russ>"
1464,1554192246.1356,Demetrice,"for i in range (1,NumTeams,2):
        print (i, i+1); I think i'm getting further away from a right answer"
1464,1554192340.1365,Sasha,"Nope, you're super close. Now how do you get from `i` to the `i`th team in your list?"
1464,1554192691.137,Demetrice,"I tried replacing the , with :  and - neither worked; I should probably just sleep on it"

1468,1554204667.1542,Valeri,I've looked it up on the internet. Still clueless :confused:
1468,1554204742.1544,Hiroko,"with django?; you can do it with a command; but otherwise, why not replicate how your task executes?; eg ```from module.tasks import Task

1468,1554205118.1641,Valeri,Creation takes time; Retrieval is paginated ofc
1468,1554205146.1649,Hiroko,you’d be surprised at how many people don’t do that; where’s the bottleneck?; is it your db?; your celery broker?
1468,1554205226.167,Valeri,I think you're missing the point here; I have to get this done asynchronously

        print(call)

I set up my Resource as follows. ```api.add_resource(Endpoint, ""/&lt;call&gt;"") ``` So, this works `curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:5000/Hi` but this returns a 404 `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(ENDPOINT, json=payload_dict)` where ENDPOINT is <http://127.0.0.1:5000>; I've also tried replacing the `json` param with `data` to no avail"
1471,1554213174.1768,Hiroko,what’s your payload dict?
1471,1554213180.1771,Carmen,This seems like a POST data vs URL params issue.
1471,1554213182.1773,Hiroko,a 400 is a bad request
1471,1554213201.1781,Lawrence,payload dict is kust a key:value dictionary
1471,1554213202.1784,Carmen,Your URL for the `requests` call isn't matching your Flask route.
1471,1554213212.1789,Lawrence,I'm able to print it out just fine - it looks correctly formatted
1471,1554213214.179,Hiroko,```127.0.0.1:5000/Hi``` suggests this is a route
1471,1554213214.1791,Carmen,POST does not put the parameters in the URL.
1471,1554213242.1799,Lawrence,<@Hiroko> Hi is the `&lt;call&gt;` variable in this case; <@Carmen> I believe you are right but I can't determine the proper route format
1471,1554213317.1815,Carmen,"So when you're using `ENDPOINT = <http://127.0.0.1:5000>`, you're making a call to that specific URL with POST data. You need to either modify `ENDPOINT` to have the `call` URL parameter, or adjust your route in Flask to not require it and instead to pull that data from the request POST data."
1471,1554213355.1819,Lawrence,ah I see
1471,1554213368.1824,Carmen,Which you do depends on whether `call` is something that you were specifying in your payload or not.
1471,1554213378.1827,Lawrence,so `ENDPOINT = ...:5000/?call=`?
1471,1554213397.183,Carmen,Just `ENDPOINT = <http://127.0.0.1:5000/Hi>`
1471,1554213483.1841,Lawrence,I was under the impression the `json` would be appended to the route as the POST data string but I now believe that is not correct; I'll look  into parsing POST data via Flask restful then
1471,1554213543.1856,Carmen,That is not correct for POST calls. Almost every HTTP request framework is going to not append the POST data to the URL. It's going to pass it as actual POST data in the request body.
1471,1554213545.1857,Hiroko,its added to the _body_ of the rewquest; not the route
1471,1554213559.1863,Lawrence,I see
1471,1554213559.1864,Hiroko,GET adds to the route with query params

1472,1554219937.1892,Ashley,<@Karl> your questions is very vague. Can you be more specific with the issue you're having?
1472,1554220396.1901,Karl,Auto remidation script for security groups
1472,1554220554.1906,Hiroko,"<@Karl> if you want help, being limited with details and descriptions is a good way to not get it"
1473,1554221293.1915,Ashley,"it helps if you tell us exactly what you're looking to accomplish, what you've tried, and issues that are blocking you"

1475,1554228571.1956,Nenita,"I have roughly around 1000 lines typed and it contains some sensitive (or could be sensitive) information. I was curious if there are any people/services that are trustworthy to look at my code briefly to offer suggestions or criticism? I am far from finishing it, but curious what people would think to help me improve as I am finishing the program. Note: It involves Tkinter P 3.0."
1475,1554228654.1963,Clemmie,can you move the sensitive information into env variables and then share the code here for review?
1475,1554229088.1974,Nenita,"thats why when i said 'could be sensitive', it's more of names of headers. Let me redact some stuff real quick.; umm, how am i suppose to post this much code?"
1475,1554229153.198,Clemmie,snippet
1475,1554229156.1981,Nenita,plus their spread across 3 modules
1475,1554229201.1989,Clemmie,ahh- harder. could you throw up a quick gitlab project and point to it?
1475,1554229233.1996,Nenita,"yea. never had a git account, but been wanting to make one to post my code for criticism more or less; un momento"
1475,1554229388.2,Jonas,A gist can help; <https://gist.github.com/> you can have multiple files.
1475,1554229677.2014,Nenita,"So i just signed up for gitlab (not sure whats the difference from github), but after creating a new project and ready to type code, i notice a lot of git keywords everywhere. am i able to copy and paste python code?"
1475,1554230030.2037,Ashley,"<@Nenita> gitlab uses `git` just like GitHub. It has a lot of the same features as GitHub (e.g. forking, PRs, issues, code review), as well as a few other additional things that GitHub doesn't have (e.g. built in CI/CD pipeline)"
1475,1554230054.2046,Lawrence,"when logging using using `logging` lib, isn't it best practice to use parameters in your message instead of `format`? e.g. `logger.debug(""This %s"", ""logger"")`"
1475,1554230062.2051,Nenita,but functional with python as well?
1476,1554230115.2059,Claudine,<@Lawrence> checkout out f-strings
1475,1554230117.2062,Claudine,the new new
1475,1554230145.2069,Ashley,"also, GitHub caught a LOT of flack a while back for changes in their policies that caused people to flock from it. For example, they made a change to their CoC that said it's better to accept code that is worse in quality if it's from someone in an underrepresented group than it is to accept better code from someone who isn't in an underrepresented group"
1475,1554230165.2071,Claudine,oof
1475,1554230168.2072,Lawrence,limited to 2.7 currently and I believe even still the parameterization is preferred according to docs
1475,1554230180.2074,Claudine,yea i think you're correct
1475,1554230244.2079,Nenita,guess ill learn more as i begin to use it more
1475,1554230302.2091,Clemmie,Orthogonal to it. Git is a distributed version control system. It doesn't really have anything to do with your code.
1475,1554230313.2095,Nenita,"anyhow, im almost finished uploading it. by the way, because the code uses a few csv files, you (whomever) may not be able to run it off the bat. If need be, i can see if i can make some quick adjustments to get it running without those csv files. really im just looking for criticism on the code rather than the actual gui, etc."
1475,1554230349.2103,Clemmie,Learning git will be an excellent addition to your skillset
1475,1554230356.2106,Ashley,you can read up on the general disaster that was here <https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/47ksmz/what_is_going_on_with_github/>
1475,1554230362.2109,Clemmie,frankly it is expected of devs at this point
1475,1554230379.2112,Ashley,"yeah, it's essential"
1475,1554230747.2124,Claudine,"definitely, or at least some sort of version control"
1475,1554230749.2126,Nenita,"so the project is private, but do i just share the link to those who are able to view it?"
1475,1554230820.2132,Lawrence,"I wouldn't if it is private unless you know someone who is a member, then DM"
1475,1554230848.2134,Nenita,"ah cool. i always miss replies because the notification is so small on my screen; well i have the link. who wants to read up on it?; i personally dont mind just posting it here, its just that its unfinished and I dont want it open(accessible)  for too long."
1475,1554231031.2152,Lawrence,"oh this is your own repo, my apologies; then post away if you'd like :slightly_smiling_face: I was under the impression it was a different org"
1475,1554231102.2162,Nenita,"yea no org. im not that 'into it' (lack of better words); <https://gitlab.com/WuchaDoin/private-invoice-system>; ive never worked with anyone on code, worked for an org on code, worked with an org on code. im entirely 'freelance', but that comes at a tremendous cost."
1475,1554231229.218,Clemmie,"yeah, you can't just  share the url of a private repo on gitlab - it is truly private."
1475,1554231235.2182,Nenita,lol
1475,1554231273.2186,Clemmie,You can use internal if you want - that limits it to people who are signed into gitlab; or just plain public
1475,1554231349.2191,Nenita,"i dont know why i feel so stupid right now, but how the heck do i share it lol; :facepalm:"
1475,1554231514.2212,Clemmie,"So there isn't so much a concept of sharing, exactly. If it stays private then you need to invite _gitlab_ users to be part of the project, via the gitlab process. If you set it to `internal` then you can just give the url and anyone with a gitlab account can look at it. if you set it to `public` you give the url and anyone can look at it"
1475,1554231634.2215,Nenita,"i cant even find where to change the private setting; there are tabs on the left hand side, but i dont see anything or know what to choose to change the sharing setting; found it; alright settings are set to internal so you should be able to use the link"
1475,1554231839.2231,Clemmie,"yup, can"
1475,1554231855.2233,Nenita,cool
1475,1554231933.2234,Clemmie,"couple of comments just from glancing at it.; snake_case, not CamelCase is preferred for function names in python"
1475,1554231995.2238,Nenita,i keep getting them mixed up; the casing and spacing is probably the most I worry about at the moment because I have spent so much time speed learning everything else
1475,1554232321.2242,Clemmie,"you can replace the `if..elif` in `ConnectQB.AdjustCX` with `if any(x in str(data['FullName']) for x in ['Charges-2:','Colleen'])`"
1475,1554232431.2244,Nenita,"never knew of that function; anyhow, i dont expect anyone to go through all of it, but to just skim through and notice little things that could be adjust as per your reply."
1475,1554232514.2248,Clemmie,"ok, ill look at a more generall level; You don't need to compare to the `True` and `False` literals - so `if test == False` is just `if not test`"
1475,1554232636.2253,Nenita,taking notes :notebook:
1475,1554232675.2255,Clemmie,There is a lot of repetition in SystemGUI
1475,1554232692.2257,Nenita,like what?
1475,1554232715.2259,Clemmie,"I would do a couple of things - split each page into it's own function and call all the page function - easier  to read; for all the elements with repeated argument use dictionary unpacking like so; you have
```   self.page1_bgn_date.pack(side='left', anchor='center', fill='none', expand=True)
        self.page1_to_label.pack(side='left', anchor='center', fill='none', expand=True)
        self.page1_end_date.pack(side='left', anchor='center', fill='none', expand=True)
```"
1475,1554232809.2267,Nenita,"yea, thats my biggest issue; thats partly why i asked someone to possibly check into it.; i dont know of a simpler method of packing a lot of widgets"
1475,1554232888.2273,Clemmie,"you can do
```
lcnt = {'side':'left', 'anchor':'center', 'fill':'none', 'expand':True}
self.page1_bgn_date.pack(**lcnt)
self.page1_to_label.pack(**lcnt)
self.page1_end_date.pack(**lcnt)
```; you can even do it where multiple params are the same, but one is different `a(**unpack_dict, param=15)`"
1475,1554233064.2277,Nenita,see im not used to (at least to me) special syntax's like the **. i will need to read up on that.
1475,1554233318.2279,Clemmie,last one before i have to run - in SystemFunctions you have a pattern of `if x: one_val else: other_val` line lines 81-98
1475,1554233375.2281,Nenita,yea those are really ugly. i have no idea how to shorten them; i appreciate you taking the time to skim over it
1475,1554233585.2286,Clemmie,"you can make a function like
```
def set_tree(tree, data, var_loc, comparator, data_loc, good_val, bad_val):
    val = bad_val
    if strvar[var_loc].get() == comparator:
       val = good_val
   tree.set(data, data_loc, value=val)
```
and call like
```
set_tree(tree, data, 0, 1, 4, 'True', 'False')
&lt;skip a few...&gt;
set_tree(tree, data, 3, 1, 5, 'None', 'Short')
```"
1475,1554233760.2288,Nenita,"let me know when you have finished looking at what you want because im going to be switching it back to private; lastly, in your opinion, with a project this size, is it usually more than a one man project or would it just take a single person a good while (also depends on exp) to create a project of this scope?"
1475,1554234050.2292,Clemmie,If that is the extent of it - one person
1475,1554234094.2294,Nenita,well thats good to know. it tells me i wont be spending too long on it. or at least more than i need to.
1475,1554234122.2296,Clemmie,you can switch it to private - I gotta poke at other stuff
1475,1554234160.2298,Nenita,thanks. just be careful where you stick your fingers :smiley:
1477,1554238690.2303,Janis,Anyone good at PyQt here?; I have like 8 buttons and I am connecting clicked event of each button to the same function. Now when the function gets triggered how do I tell which button got clicked in those 8 buttons
1477,1554238846.2312,Nenita,"Not sure, I dont post tkinter issues often, but i do get some help every now and then when needed"
1477,1554238900.2318,Janis,Hmm maybe you have an idea about it
1477,1554238968.2327,Nenita,"not sure on syntax or functions for pyqt. ive only used tkinter, but with using checkbuttons, tkinter uses stringvar() in order to store a textvaraible."
1477,1554238992.2333,Janis,Those are pushButtons not checkboxes
1477,1554238999.2335,Nenita,"i use that, not to tell which button was pressed, but because of what stringvar it is i can tell which button was pressed; yea i know, i just was pointing out i use stringvar with checkbuttons"
1477,1554239043.2346,Janis,Well i am using same text name for every button as they will be performing same operation
1477,1554239082.2348,Nenita,would you mind posting some code?
1477,1554239118.2349,Janis,None; similar to above we have 7 more buttons; and reset_one is the function where i want to know which button got pressed so that i can perform some action
1477,1554239465.2365,Nenita,"from the look of it, it seems similar to something i'd have to do in certain situations. i.e using the button name/id as the button variable in a function. Again, i apologize im not familiar with pyqt, but hopefully this will give some idea."
1477,1554239525.2373,Janis,I don't think that helps but nvm thanks for at least trying
1477,1554239618.2381,Nenita,"yea sorry. its even hard for me to find live help on tkinter from time to time, but thankfully tkinter is a little more strightforward imo.; <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/pyqt_qpushbutton_widget.htm>; the example at the bottom of the page may be helpful :shrug:"
1477,1554239907.2395,Janis,Lol thanks that was what I was looking aswell
1477,1554240621.2402,Demetrice,So i thought to myself as a project i'd build monopoly. And i sat down today to build it i realized i had no idea how to start; Logically speaking i should write the board first. But i don't even know how to begin that conceptually. I'm looking into it and thinking i might have to use a grid.
1477,1554240844.2416,Nenita,"yep, thats basically me on everything lmao"
1477,1554241045.2422,Demetrice,This stuff is hard man. I know what monopoly looks like in my head. I play it all the time but i have no idea how to write it
1477,1554241124.2431,Nenita,"id work with the moment first (rolling die, taking turns, moving board pieces) first and then figure out the required math afterword.; because then you'd be working off the framework of taking turns and rotation"
1477,1554242048.2443,Clemmie,<@Demetrice> if you are on during US work hours tomorrow ping me - I'm happy to work through a design brainstrom with you; <@Nenita> <@Demetrice> we can make it a group dm or private channel
1477,1554242131.2449,Nenita,Sounds fun
1477,1554244199.2457,Demetrice,<@Clemmie> Yes! I'm off tomorrow too! I'll just put it on my schedule for tomorrow; Having people who actually know what they're doing to bounce idea's off of would be great
1477,1554244241.2463,Clemmie,I'm not! But I can work with you while I work
1478,1554245133.2467,Marceline,Has anyone used mailgun 
1479,1554253937.248,Rodrick,Hello all I was wondering in python if it is possible in a text file to see what line a string is one
1479,1554253972.2486,Carmen,"To clarify, you're wanting to find what the line number is that matches a specific string?"
1479,1554253977.2488,Rodrick,Correct
1479,1554253997.2493,Carmen,"Can the string be repeated in the file? If so, do you need just the first line, or all lines?"
1479,1554254023.2497,Rodrick,Uhhhh; hmmm; it would be like this; `Line 1: ryan is cool`; `Line 2: joe is cool`; and thats in a whole library; i want to find the string `ryan is cool`
1479,1554254257.255,Carmen,"The snarky answer to your original question is, ""Yes, Python can do anything that any piece of software can do, including finding a string in a file.""

The slightly more helpful answer for someone just getting started is, ""Use the `readlines` method on the file object you're reading from, then iterate through the list of lines comparing them to your search string. Keep track of the line you're on through an integer you increment each loop. When you find a match, print the line integer and break out of the loop (if you only need to find the first match)."""
1479,1554254325.2564,Rodrick,"Ok, but is there a piece of code thats is like `linethestringison = readlineget(""joe is cool"")`"
1479,1554254339.2567,Sasha,"For something like this, `for i, line in enumerate(myfile)` would work well. Match against the data in `line`, and `i` will be the corresponding line number."
1479,1554254347.2569,Rodrick,ok; What does `enumerate` do?
1479,1554254505.2587,Sasha,"It takes a list/iterator/whatever and gives you both the item number and the item as a tuple. So `enumerate(""foo"")` would give you `(0, ""f""), (1, ""o""), (2, ""o"")`.; Very handy when you want to keep track of a list index as well as access the data conveniently."
1479,1554254582.2602,Carmen,"You will need to define a function `readlineget` that takes your search string, does the searching process, and returns the line number. Python doesn't have a built-in function to do that.; <@Sasha> Purely for my curiosity (and to avoid having to dig into the docs) do you know if enumerating a file object like that reads the entire file into a list, or if it uses a generator to do it lazily?"
1479,1554254702.2621,Sasha,"It should be lazy, give or take some amount of buffering in the file I/O."
1479,1554254721.2623,Carmen,"About what I expected. Groovy.; `enumerate` isn't in my normal toolkit, so I'm not familiar with its semantics."
1479,1554254945.264,Sasha,"It's rarely required to solve a problem, but it'll often save you a line or two by eliminating manually incremented counter variables, etc."
1479,1554254995.2644,Carmen,"Which is primarily what I'm thinking of, since I use those all the fecking time in my scripts."
1480,1554255323.2648,Marceline,<@Sasha> Hey! how have you been; Been a while
1480,1554255425.2659,Sasha,"Just fine, thanks!"

We have a django view that inside the view it's uses a class that send request to external service. I'm looking on how to swap the class call; I'm been trying to do something like:
```
join = Join()
        foo = join .post(request=json.dumps({
                   'foo': 'bar'
                }))
        print(foo)
```
and getting
```
json_serialized = self.serializer_class(data=request.data)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'data'
```; So.. How to pass to a django view a request object via test?"
1485,1554275543.2905,Valeri,What is Join?; Is join the view that you're talking about?
1485,1554275645.2911,Rayford,"Join is the view; It look like this:
```
class Join(GenericAPIView):
    permission_classes = (AllowAny,)
    serializer_class = Serializer

    def post(self, request):
        json_serialized = self.serializer_class(data=request.data)
```; It's a poorly designed project and now we start to fix it"
1485,1554276021.2965,Russ,"Well, `json.dumps` returns a `string`, so that won't work.
You'd want to read about testing in Django. But in a few words: inherit your test class from `django.test.TestCase` and then do `<http://self.client.post|self.client.post>({'foo': 'bar'})` it will return you a response object where you can inspect response code, body, etc."
1485,1554276111.2974,Valeri,Views should be called using `as_view`
1485,1554276115.2977,Rayford,"<@Russ> Yes, I'm doing that in another place but since I want to swap an inner class that the view call I cannot use the client of django"
1485,1554276126.2979,Valeri,I meant there are other ways to do this ofcourse; But `as_view` has served me the best tbh; <https://stackoverflow.com/a/14957571/6403406>
1485,1554276175.2991,Rayford,But how can I invoke the post class?; post action*
1485,1554276185.2995,Valeri,That's what I'm talking about; `View.as_view({'post': 'post'})(request)` should probably work
1485,1554276331.3006,Rayford,And request should be the payload I'm testing?
1485,1554276643.3012,Valeri,request is an `HttpRequest` object
1485,1554276648.3013,Rayford,Like that `foo = Join.as_view({'post': 'post'})({'foo': 'bar'})`?
1485,1554276658.3015,Valeri,Nope; The payload goes in as keyword args; Oh wow; Your `post` does not accept `kwargs`; Well you'll have to make an `HttpRequest` object and pass your payload inside the `data` attribute of the object
1485,1554276804.3042,Rayford,:S; I'm pretty knew to django and kind of conused. Any change for an example on how to do that in a test? This is what I'm trying to achieve here
1485,1554277969.3066,Dominique,In a method in a class I want to create a new object of the same class. Is there a better way than self.__class__(...)?
1486,1554279075.3071,Rayford,Any help? I'm pretty lost here
1485,1554279327.3074,Valeri,<@Rayford> <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/>; This should really help you
1485,1554279482.3079,Jimmy,`self.__class__` will work with inheritance so that's the best way afaik

1485,1554279521.3092,Rayford,"<@Valeri> But test an http request. I'm trying to pass a request object to a view class; Since the logic which interact with external service is in the view it self; They did not wrote a class that holds all the logic for that; So i'm trinng to do this:
```

1497,1554343683.3746,Carmen,"Some questions to help you wrap your head around what you need:
• How much raw processing is needed for what the app is doing? Is it crunching a lot of numbers per request? More processing means you need more processors.
• How many users will you need to support concurrently? More concurrent users = more connections at a time = more processors and more RAM.
• How large are your data structures and responses? If you have to load 500MB of data into memory for each request to do the processing, your RAM requirements are much higher than if you're doing iterative file processing line by line.
• Do you need to be storing data? User uploads, generated files being downloaded by users, etc. More of those means more disk space needed.; One thing that will absolutely help you out is to run some benchmarks on your existing code. Use a testing tool like Apache JMeter to simulate load on your app and see how it performs.; Your goal is to see how your server behaves, and whether you start bogging down because of lack of RAM, lack of CPUs, or something else."

2) CAS is simpler and has easier implementation as compared to SAML

1500,1554372198.3921,Virgil,"<@Sharee> ML is a better choice, especially if you're in Pakistan"
1500,1554372220.3926,Sharee,i m an indian; bro
1500,1554372245.3933,Virgil,"I'm not really sure about the Indian Tech Market, but still I'd suggest you to go with ML"
1500,1554372253.3936,Sharee,okk; what if we say globally ?
1500,1554372286.3945,Virgil,"After you get the grasp of it and also along the way, it'd be easier for you to understand the concepts of Data Science; As per my understanding of Data Science, it is more of an analytical branch. Whereas ML is dependant on your Programming and Algorithm skill, if you look at it from Top Down approach. In case of Bottom Up approach, you need to be good with Maths."
1500,1554372691.3984,Malika,can anyone explain how does cumsum() be used in pandas.Dataframe.groupby(); <#C07EFMZ1N|help>
1500,1554372755.3991,Sharee,thanks asif bhai
1500,1554372841.4004,Malika,"and also can dates from one column be compared with dates from other column when both are put in a tuple inside two totally different column.


PS: All part of same dataframe; <#C07EFMZ1N|help>"
1500,1554373065.4008,Virgil,Anytime brother
1500,1554373086.401,Melynda,"I'd probably do something with a queue for this. The node server can put items into a queue, a Python worker can pick it up, process it, and return the results through the queue mechanism.; Celery is a very popular toolset for Python to talk to a multitude of queue back-ends (RabbitMQ, Redis, Beanstalk, etc, etc); <http://www.celeryproject.org/>"
1502,1554374835.4016,Dawn,hm but what would you put into the queue? it would still be python reading the model and giving output values right?
1502,1554375767.405,Conchita,"I have four py scripts I want to initialise from another py script. Would `init.py` run `script.py` if I do like this?

script.py
```
def foo():
    print('poo')

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    foo()```

init.py
```
from . import script

script.main()```"
1503,1554375995.4073,Virgil,<@Conchita> there's no method called main() you'll have to do script.foo()
1502,1554376025.4083,Russ,"Try it and see :slightly_smiling_face:
But if you don't want/can't - no, it won't run saying `script` has no such function `main`, or something like that. To run them from your `init` call `script.foo()`, i.e. you need to call existing function"
1502,1554376057.4089,Virgil,"If you want to run all the function through a single function, just do this
```
def main():
    script.foo()
    script.bar()
    script.whatever()
```

And then do ```script.main()```"
1502,1554376148.4096,Conchita,Great thanks! <@Virgil> &amp; <@Russ>
1502,1554376667.4101,Melynda,"Yeah – just put any required input values in the queue. Say if your ML models were doing image recognition, put the path to the image in the queue. Python opens that, gives it the model, processes it…"
1502,1554376691.4103,Dawn,"ok yeah but then you still have a python server running somewhere; what i mean is, produce your model locally and save it (in a pickle for instance) in a repository, and have a node.js server handle that saved model. no model training done on the server"
1503,1554376925.4107,Melynda,"I wouldn't expect Node to understand a pickled object at all. If there are open standards that both Node and Python can agree on, I don't see why Node couldn't process a file from Python. TensorFlow, for example…?"
1504,1554382377.4113,Carmen,"<@Rodrick> A few points:
1) Pinging someone to answer your question if you're not replying to one of their comments is considered rude. Just ask your question and anyone who can help will jump in.
2) You didn't ask a question. The only thing I've seen is you posting that you wanted to make something. If you have a specific question, you need to ask it clearly, not assume we know what you're looking for.; The most important question is: Which protocol does your Identity Provider support? If it only supports one of them, then you've pretty much already got your choice made for you. If it can support both, pick the one that has an easier library to work with for your app.; <@Conchita> Adding a bit more information here, the `if __name__ == ""__main__"":` check will only be true if the file in question (`script.py` in this case) is being directly executed by Python instead of imported by another script. This SO answer covers it in depth: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/419185/>"
1503,1554384699.4138,Freeda,"Alright I give up, I can't figure out this dang function; I'm so bad at making these, any tips/good tutorials would be greatly appreciated"
1503,1554384826.415,Clemmie,"<@Freeda> what are you trying to do, what have you tried, and what errors/failures are you seeing?; If you have some code to show please do"
1503,1554385977.4162,Freeda,"I'm trying to apply this function to a dataframe; it's pretty easy to understand what I'm trying to do, I'm just missing something here; These are the columns I'm looking at; And this is the code I have so far; and this is the error I'm getting; If you have any tips on what I should focus on for learning, lmk.  I feel like I need to work on building functions and types in python"
1503,1554386622.4196,Clemmie,"That actually looks pretty ok to me, besides the error. I don’t have a ton of experience with pandas - but I think that contains call works a little differently than you are using it (maybe). Maybe ask in the <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> channel - there is lots of pandas expertise over there"
1505,1554387285.4239,Cedrick,"When I am writing the __init__ method for a class and I would like to use an intermediary value, is it safe to just use a normal variable like below? Will it be cleaned up properly and gone once the method completes?

```
class Thing(object):
    def __init__(self, input):
        intermediary = input + 1
        self.value = intermediary + 1
```
(ignoring the over simplicity and pointlessness of the example); I want to ensure that intermediary value is gone and not some class/static member"
1505,1554387381.4256,Clemmie,"You sure can, but it doesn’t look like the best way to go; can you talk a little about why you want/need to do it?"
1505,1554387502.4279,Cedrick,"well in my class I am consuming some xml and I'm using xpath to get a list of sub nodes (the intermediary) and then that list I pass to another function in a list comprehension. So the intermediary is there for readability, I could just be putting the xpath in the comprehension but that looks messy.; ```
class ColorChange(object):
    def __init__(self, xml):

1505,1554387615.4294,Clemmie,with that use case it looks just fine
1505,1554387625.4296,Cedrick,"cool, thanks!; I guess I am also curious about how people would feel about my use of __dict__ there ... these objects need to be json serializable so I am using that for now... although there is the possibility of needing to write a .to_dict() method later down the road in case I don't want to serialize everything in it like a method."

1507,1554391232.4341,Dawn,is there a way to parse jsonL with the regular json pacakge in python?; it's basically every json object on a new line i think
1507,1554391369.4352,Clemmie,"I don’t think so, or at least not without munging first. A quick search found this package <https://github.com/wbolster/jsonlines>"
1507,1554391427.4358,Dawn,"hm yeah wanted to prevent installing additional packages but i guess it's the only way to go; annoying that people just don't adhere standards... :stuck_out_tongue:; thanks anyways; got it to work with the regular json package

1507,1554392991.4371,Clemmie,"oh, good thinking"
1508,1554393569.4377,Freeda,"<@Clemmie> thanks for deferring me to <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> , helped a lot; ended up with this, actually on my own but they explained why I wasn't able to do it with pandas"

1509,1554397462.4396,Nenita,"Alright, I've tried this two ways and it's beginning to frustrate me. The problem is in this line: for i, val in enumerate(lists[1].get(0, tk.END)), my list has 1 item. When the enumeration begins at 0 and hits its max len which is 1 item (rather 0), it just kills the function rather than continue. I cannot find a way to say ""if you've reached the end of the list and the item wasn't found, then add the item""; <@Christal> just create a new line for df3.to_csv(""new file name""); if you havent already done df = df.append(df2) or whatever your looking to do; although i hate append because it always appends vertically rather than horizontally. i usually use:"
1509,1554397987.4432,Clemmie,<@Nenita> if I understand it correctly you want to use the `for...else` construct. Whatever is in the `else` clause will fire if the loop completes without `break`ing
1509,1554398025.4436,Nenita,correct. i just need to do something when it finishes the iterration; other than just ending
1509,1554398059.4448,Clemmie,"on the last element, regardless of whether it encountered a `break` or not?"
1509,1554398127.4453,Nenita,ill need the break at the last as long as its after if check == val; this works but even after break it still fires which i dont need it to
1509,1554398186.4459,Clemmie,right - use that but add an `else`; None
1509,1554398214.4467,Nenita,wait! you can use for with else?
1509,1554398223.4469,Clemmie,that will run the final line if and only if the for loop completed without ever encountering a `break`
1509,1554398289.4482,Nenita,holy i never knew you could use else with for. that helps so much
1509,1554398291.4484,Clemmie,"it is esoteric, and you are probably better off figuring out a more understandable way of doing it (it will confuse many pythonistas, even fairly senior) but it is the stated behavior of the construct"

1510,1554399477.4494,Alline,"Hi everyone! Is there a way to test if my solution is using imported methods which have been deprecated? Just so that I can just pip install the target versions of my dependencies and fix everything that needs updating. I've only noted deprecation warning when such methods are actually called, and I fear that some of them might not be used that often (and usually when I write unit tests for my solution I mock third party library .. maybe THIS is the problem, in which case I'd rush immediately to the testing_ channel)"
1510,1554400065.4518,Nenita,"<@Alline> from what i've been reading online, deprecation warnings have to be declared therefore, if the methods don't contain a deprecation warning, i would check out this. it looks like you may be able to set it up for testing, but not sure if it's what you're looking for. other than that, i thankfully haven't received much deprecation warnings so i don't focus on it much, more over, have much knowledge on handing deprecation. <https://pypi.org/project/deprecation/>"

1513,1554410592.458,Raguel,"I think one way would be that when you create your lambda function, in environment variables provide credentials, and then call them in your scripts like this
```usr = os.environ['usr']
pwd= os.environ['pwd']
path = os.environ['path']```
and then use sqlalchemy or any library to create connection.; I am not sure if that is the best way to go about it!"

I am using the IEX cloud API to gather some stock data and using the `pyEX` package from here but I'd like to monkey patch it to change the _URL_PREFIX in the _getJsonIEXCloud() function of common.py; Here's the package: <https://github.com/timkpaine/pyEX>; basically I would like to monkey patch common.py like so; actually now that I'm looking atit this would require patching every function across the whole package since they all call `_getJson(url, token, version)` (see `stocks.py` for example; is there a better way? main reason I want to do this is that this will only call the real API in its current state, which wastes messages that cost money during development."
1514,1554425199.4656,Sasha,"Is it possible to only apply the patch when you start up with a ""debug mode"" setting, rather than trying to pass in a runtime sandbox flag for each call?"
1514,1554425729.4661,Frankie,"sure, but I think the problem is still that the client doesn't actually control the call of the getJson() function; I suppose I could just patch the _URL_PREFIX_2 variable in debug mode I guess?"
1514,1554425854.467,Sasha,Good thought.

_URL_PREFIX2 = '<https://cloud.iexapis.com/{version}/>'

if os.environ.get('DJANGO_ENV') == 'DEV':

Anything wrong w/ that? This happens to be in a django project so I will have that set; Also is it possible to change that from outside the actual package file? like in my own code can I do something like
```
import pyEX
pyEX.common._URL_PREFIX2 = 'blah blah blah'

1514,1554426032.4697,Frankie,I didn't know you could actually override a variable from outside the module. huh...TIL; that makes this 1000 times simpler
1514,1554426167.4707,Sasha,"I'm not 100% sure whether you need to import the common module directly to do that, but if you run into trouble, that's something to try."

1515,1554427592.4777,Alishia,"Hello, I came across this function called range(), and I realised in the documentation, that there are 2 ways to call the function.
1. range(stop)
2. range(start, stop[, step])
What I don't understand is that in the documentation, it seems like there is 2 function declaration. (or is it a class?)
```
class range(stop)
class range(start, stop[, step])

Does python allow repeated function declaration?"
1514,1554427630.478,Sasha,"No, but it does allow optional parameters."
1515,1554427672.4791,Alishia,"Hi Ed, in the function declaration, all 3 params for range(start, stop[, step]) are optional; since the order is start, stop, step"
1515,1554427761.4814,Sasha,"Probably internally it's defined like `def range(first=None, second=None, third=None)` or something arbitrary like that, and the code takes care of figuring out what to do."
1515,1554427849.4825,Alishia,"so it probably checks if second arg is present. and if its present, they set it as the 'stop'?"

    csv_path = BASE_DIR + f'/data/{coin}/{coin}_{todays_date}.csv'

And this code:

        for num in range(1,11):
            run = Bitinfo(coin, num)

    main()
```

Gets ```line 110, in main
    df2 = df2.append(x)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'df2' referenced before assignment``` ?"
1517,1554431651.486,Sasha,"You need a `global df2` inside the function if you intend to modify global variables, as opposed to just read them.; In the first example all the code was executing in the global context instead of inside a function scope."
1516,1554432103.487,Conchita,Are you a wizard <@Sasha>? You always seem to have good answers!
1517,1554432159.4876,Sasha,"I've just made thousands of errors over the years, including that one.  :sweat:"
1517,1554432727.4881,Marth,I just learned too!  :taco: <@Sasha>
1517,1554432922.49,Sasha,"BTW, this can be subtle. You only need the `global` if you are *reassigning* the variable. If you are, say, appending an item to a global list, it's still the same list object, so it's not necessary, even though the contents are being modified."
1518,1554435249.491,Chuck,"Is there a function naming convention used by the Python community when you need to make a copy of a function so you can work on significant code changes without breaking existing code?; Or, perhaps, a convention for doing that that has nothing to with naming?"
1517,1554435550.4923,Sasha,"Often that's handled by your source control system, in that you can work on a branch of the code until your change is finalized and ready to be incorporated for release."
1518,1554435842.4948,Carmen,"Normally if I have to do something like that and it doesn't make sense to put it in a branch for development, I have 3 functions: the public function everything else uses, and then two internal functions that the public function calls based on its own logic. One internal function is the old function, and the other is the new function."
1518,1554435857.4953,Chuck,"Hmmm, how often would you branch for a single function rewrite? I guess that depends on the coder; <@Carmen> I like that approach"
1518,1554435873.4961,Carmen,"Normally you'd use a configuration switch to dictate which internal function gets executed.; That also lets you A/B test for specific users.; That said, if you're making significant changes, often you really should be doing it on a separate branch so that you can make the switch wholesale."
1518,1554435949.4982,Chuck,"I do need to wrap my brain around creating branches in Git, and absorbing the changes back into my main code base -- even though I'm the only dev and the only user of the code, it would be useful to understand"
1518,1554435995.4989,Carmen,"`git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;`
`git commit`
`git checkout master`
`git merge &lt;branch name&gt;`; Branches are even easier to create in Git than they are in other source control systems."
1518,1554436127.5003,Chuck,"So... let's say I have a (windows 7) directory called ""MyProject"" in which my current code resides... How do I work on a branch while also being able to execute the non-branch version of the code?"
1518,1554436340.501,Sasha,"If you want them both to be simultaneously accessible, you'd want to checkout a second copy of your git repo in a different directory."
1518,1554436413.5022,Chuck,"Okay, so I could have ""MyProject"" and ""MyProject_Branch"". I leave ""MyProject"" untouched, I work on the code in ""MyProject_Branch"", and when I'm ready, I merge the changes in ""MyProject_Branch"" back into ""MyProject""..."
1518,1554436470.5032,Sasha,"Well, this is only if you need to run them both side-by-side. Any git repo can be on any branch, and can change branches easily.; So people typically will just switch back and forth in their main git directory as needed."
1518,1554436713.5045,Chuck,how do I change between the master and the branch in the same directory?; (unless I misunderstood what you meant by this: `So people typically will just switch back and forth in their main git directory as needed.`)
1518,1554436892.5057,Sasha,The `git checkout [branch]` command that <@Carmen> referenced changes it.
1518,1554436978.5059,Chuck,"okay, here goes"
1518,1554437038.5065,Sasha,"Hang on. Don't ever say ""okay, here goes"" with git. Look up the docs and understand the command, please..."
1518,1554437051.5069,Chuck,"lol, good advice :slightly_smiling_face:"
1518,1554437060.5074,Sasha,"There's a separate way to create branches, for instance."
1518,1554437076.5077,Chuck,I never do anything destructive that I can't walk away from :slightly_smiling_face:; well... never intentionally... I learned that a few mistakes ago. :wink:
1518,1554437285.5089,Sasha,Obligatory: <https://ohshitgit.com/>
1518,1554437301.5092,Chuck,"<@Sasha> and <@Carmen> -- thanks both, this was a very useful conversation to me :taco:; Do either of you use PyCharm?; Just wondering if there is any way in PyCharm to see at a glance which 'branch' you currently have activated; ah... bottom right; okay, so that went okay... i created a branch, and merged it back into the master -- although I wish it had been a little more guided than throwing conflict text into the source code.; I think the only real 'downside' I could see was that the branch changes have to be committed before you can go back to the master, and vice versa -- although this does make sense"
1518,1554442654.5129,Sasha,There's `git stash` if you want to save uncommitted changes temporarily.
1518,1554442668.5134,Chuck,it looks like PyCharm can do that as well; is it normal on a merge that you get all the conflicted code in  the source code and then you manually go remove / resolve the conflicts by editing the source?; or did I do that part non-optimally?
1518,1554442828.5159,Sasha,"There are graphical tools which can make that friendlier, and if you know you want to keep one version or the other, you can force a ""mine or theirs"" merge, but yeah, generally the philosophy is that in case of conflict, you want to have human eyes on it."
1518,1554442853.5163,Chuck,that must be a huge task if you're merging in a lot of changes across a complex project; or if you're trying to resolve conflicts from a branch when the master has moved along significantly via other branch merges...
1518,1554443082.5199,Sasha,"Depends. Many changes in large codebases tend to merge without manual intervention, since people aren't editing the same lines simultaneously."
1518,1554444463.5208,Chuck,"Yep, that might have been my mistake... I think I commented out the change I had started on in the 'master' after I created the branch, so there were probably changes outstanding in both; <@Sasha> Have another one of :taco:; You're absolutely right -- I just tested creating a branch, and merging it back with a known committed master, and no conflicts, just brought the change in from the branch; Last question, is it standard to remove branches that have been merged back into the master? or do you leave them there as a history?"
1518,1554445215.5253,Sasha,"That's a good question, and I'm not quite sure, but I think common best practice would be to remove the branch if you don't plan any further work on it. A branch is basically just a label for a particular commit that shows up in a list of branches, so all the history is preserved either way, and you can recreate it later pointing to the same or a different commit if you want.; The exception would be that some people use release branches, so it's useful to keep the ""v1.2"" release tagged in the repo indefinitely."
1518,1554445390.5269,Chuck,Fair enough... some conversation on SO seeming to indicate a general consensus to remove merged branches; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5330145/when-to-delete-branches-in-git>
1519,1554447234.5275,Virgil,"<@Carmen> thanks for your response. I guess I wasn't clear with my question, apologies for that. I have to implement an internal central auth server, which would act as a provider"

1519,1554449351.5314,Chelsey,"Any VS Code gurus out there? I'm really liking the IDE, but sometimes it fails a bit on recognising imports, which flags warnings, and then doesn't format code properly (since it doesn't recognise eg. a model). The code is fine, as it runs OK, it's just display in the IDE itself.

I'm using flake8 for linting, intellisense is turned on, jedi is disabled. Any suggestions? I find it really irritating :slightly_smiling_face:

Here's an example:"
1520,1554449547.532,Jimmy,does the python extension point to the correct virtualenv ?
1520,1554454806.5331,Chelsey,"<@Jimmy>. Yep :slightly_smiling_face: Should have mentioned that as well.; (If it didn't the rest_framework imports would also be underlined, as it's the only env with that installed...)"
1520,1554454860.534,Jimmy,then idk but I think I had the same happens in some projects
1520,1554455834.5355,Chelsey,"That's what I seem to be landing on - that it ""just happens"" sometimes. Bloody annoying though, and I'm a little compulsive when it comes to warnings and errors, so it really grates :slightly_smiling_face: Hopefully some release in the near future will sort out the intellisense for python ...; If anybody is interested. I think the problem is that intellisense doesn't recognise my python project directory.

I have this kind of setup:

```
root project dir
|
-&gt; .vscode
-&gt; djangoproj
    |-&gt; Project
    |-&gt; App1
    |-&gt; App2
-&gt; docker-compose.yml
-&gt; Dockerfile
-&gt; requirements.txt
-&gt; etc.
```
Within the project, the code runs fine with `from app1.model import ModelX`, but intellisense thinks it's starting in the root project dir, not in the Django project dir. If I change the line to `from djangoproj.app1.model import ModelX` the intellisense is happy, but of course that doesn't run.

I can't find any workspace setting to amend the root directory that intellisense uses to look for modules within the project itself."

If they have specific requirements for protocols, that makes the determination for you as well.

You can always transition later to a different piece of software as your identity provider (though that can admittedly be a difficult task).; <@Sasha> <@Chuck> I know I'm chiming in rather late on this, but a few thoughts from my experience:

• Removing branches is not so common in other SCMs like SVN, but I see it fairly commonly in Git repos. Branch early, branch often, and throw them away when you don't need them anymore.
• `git tag` should be your go-to for release versioning."

(2) In your `while` loop, `and` doesn't quite work like that. You would want `while angle1 in angles and angle2 in angles` instead. (3) You might want to switch to a `while True` loop and `break` out of it on invalid input, which would avoid the duplication of the `input` statements. (4) It's sometime confusing to reuse the same variable for different purposes. Here you have `angle1` being an angle string for some parts of the code, and a hex character for other parts. You could do `hex1 = angles[angle1]` or something like that to be clearer."

1536,1554562688.6365,Carissa,"hello devs, i stuck in a situation and need some suggestion to tackle this
So what exactly is happening
User is filling some form (or say writing some blogs on medium) , now the tab he/she is writing is logged in and now another tab opens logged out the user and closes
So currently the tab in which the user is writing blogs shows that user is logged in but actually his/her session get expired
So now when user save the blogs then blog will not get saved and response from server shows that the user has been logged out and now when we redirect user for login again then at that time all the data will get lost(the written blog)
So my main question is to how to save the blog"
1534,1554563529.6368,Carmen,"Browser localstorage.; Also, you could add an AJAX timeout notification for them, so that they get a warning that they're about to be logged out and let them click a button to refresh their session."

AJAX request is avoided by my team and Browser local storage is a good opinion i will implement it

I was using vagrant and was trying to do port forwarding when the 400 response first came up. "
1536,1554607642.6419,Sasha,"That's not a lot of info to go on, but my first instincts would be to (a) try to undo whatever change you did that started causing the errors, (b) look at the logs of whatever server you're using to handle those requests."
1536,1554607903.642,Erline,I wish I could figure out how to be more specific; I see that Apache has error logs and access logs. The access logs don’t say all that much. Are there other places to look for logs that should be considered?

1542,1554648699.677,Valeri,<@Donnell> If you're on wifi you're already on the same network; You just need to expose your database port number to your local network; And access it from elsewhere using the server IP and port number
1542,1554649399.6803,Donnell,"<@Valeri> Our systems are wired. We are connected using Ethernet from a switch. Router is connected to Switch.; From this switch, the ethernet cables are connected to computers."
1542,1554649470.681,Valeri,Cool; Just expose the database on your local network
1542,1554649555.682,Donnell,umm Can you give an example?
1543,1554650627.6838,Leida,"often, opening an app to the network is the difference of configuring the IP:PORT from 127.0.0.1:PORT to 0.0.0.0:PORT. Dont know about MySQL instance tho. Heres a discussion that might help <https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=960675>"

In a conversation with my manager, he said should make a system as our local server for development purpose where you all will access MySql database and work with it."
1543,1554651552.6876,Leida,to have access from LAN you need something that would serve up the database - the server; what OS are you on?
1543,1554651572.6882,Donnell,We run Windows 10 on all the systems.
1543,1554651733.6891,Leida,<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html> this seems quite comprehensive but it also means there is alot to read xD; you will probably want to install the server as a service so that you dont have to manually start it every time the computer restarts: <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-start-service.html>
1543,1554651860.6904,Donnell,Yeah. We downloaded *MySQL Community Server* from <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>; and Installed in our computers and status is active.; Did we do it right?
1543,1554651995.6917,Leida,<https://medium.com/@kasunsiyambalapitiya/how-to-setup-a-mysql-server-on-local-area-network-lan-c3c5012c7d6b> here it explain how to open it up to lan on both linux and windows; something about creating a cnf file setting the IP
1543,1554652040.6926,Donnell,"Oh great! thanks for the article <@Leida>; And we have now the LAN as barrier. Trying to figure out how to setup. This is new to me. I've found some YouTube videos on software configuration on systems that are to be connected to each other. But before that, I want to get confirmation if we are good with Hardware setup and go to software configuration.; Our ISP's Internet cable is connected to Router.
Router --&gt; Switch
Switch --&gt; Computers; Are we good to go?"
1543,1554653125.6963,Virgil,"<@Carmen>
1) Yes, there 4 existing systems but they work independent of each other, communicating with the same DBs. But moving them from regular auth structure to SSO is upto me as well, so no specific requirement.
2) Do you have some experience with CAS or SAML?"
1544,1554653237.6981,Sasha,"Yep, that's pretty standard. For local network comms, the machines should be able to access each other through the switch. However, your router is probably giving everyone dynamic network addresses, which may or may not be constant over time. You might need to configure the router to give a predictable address to the machine acting as the MySQL server so that the other machines know how to find it. For the mean time, you can get things tested using whatever address is happens to have, though."
1544,1554653385.6982,Carmen,"I do not have direct experience with it. I've just done a decent bit of research on it in the past.; So if I were you I'd set up one of the existing SSO identity providers, whichever one is easiest and least expensive for you to setup, and then integrate the other systems with it.; Which protocol you decide on for those other integrations once again boils down to which library is most convenient for you to work with.; It seems like there might be a bit of terminology confusion here. ""Server"" has two separate meanings in this context. You have the database server software, MySQL Server. That's what is listening on your network and what your clients connect to. You also have the database server hardware, which is whatever machine is connected to the network and running MySQL Server.; Any computer can be a server, but typically for something like that you want a dedicated server, which is just a machine that's always on and isn't running other things (e.g. being used as a desktop for the secretary or another developer)."
1545,1554653802.7017,Donnell,Sure <@Sasha> thanks for confirmation.
1544,1554653924.7019,Donnell,"<@Carmen> Yes little bit confusion with terminology. So for our project, we need to have centralized database. But in conversation with our project manager, he was saying we need to have a computer working as Server and should have database. So maybe he is saying a dedicated server for this?; So XAMP would help me make the computer as dedicated server ?"
1544,1554654261.7023,Carmen,"Whether something is a server or not is entirely dependent on what you do with it and whether it's dedicated to that task. If you install MySQL on it, and it's dedicated to providing those database services to other apps, it's now your dedicated database server."
1543,1554654414.7025,Virgil,"There 2 or 3 options available for Django, I like django-mama-cas with django-cas-ng for clients.; Thanks for your time :slightly_smiling_face: I really appreciate it"
1544,1554655024.7029,Donnell,Oh ok. So I will confirm with him and I'll be back if I have any doubts regarding it. Thanks a lot <@Carmen>

So I’m just exploring the possibilities at the moment.; I’m not a security professional, so that’s unlikely, but it doesn’t hurt to figure out if it’s an option! "

Is it better to store the recurring events as single occurrences?"
1553,1554679379.7745,Sparkle,What are u trying to clean? Are you trying to just trim the values that have trailing spaces; An example with before and after would be most helpful

```""NQd9pW2TZq9Eiemtb,5110061149.38249,407355,2018-04-30 03:17:25,407357,2018-04-30 03:24:43""

1561,1554734783.8457,Johna,"hey all! i was trying this experiment over the weekend… my brother has a dungeons and dragons character generator spreadsheet in google sheets. he added some functions to generate them with a click of a button based on the predetermined stats he has for each monster in another sheet. he said it works okay but has some issues around managing states, it’s sluggish, and it’s missing a few features he’d like. i was trying to write a no-database application so i wrote a character dataclass and tried to instantiate a bunch of instances of that class in memory with the instances named based on their names (row data) in the csv. that is to say he had a csv that is like:
```
Creature_Name, Max_HP
Bat, 1
Hero, 20
```
and I wrote a dataclass for character then was trying to “grab” each character to generate the objects, where i’d want the output to be the same result as hand typing:
```
bat = character(name='Bat', max_hp=1)
hero = character(name='Hero', max_hp=20)
```
(there are a looooot of characters in his sheet so hand typing it is a nightmare); though the end goal is probably a flask app so i’m thinking this may be a bad approach? store the data in a database and call it as needed?; but let’s say it wasn’t a flask app and i wanted to create characters in like, pygame or kivy or something… would a database still be the best approach?; i started getting into that terrible space of looping through a csv and using `exec()` with f strings which i know is not usually a good idea…. but i can’t think of another way to do it?"
1561,1554734990.8485,Jimmy,I would use sqlite; you don't need a whole database server and it's easy to move around
1561,1554735009.8493,Johna,"yeah… i saw that pandas has a to_sqlite function i think; might be an easy way to convert a csv to a database; i see, i didn’t know that about sqlite"
1561,1554735128.8512,Jimmy,your brother could even use something like sqllite browser to go and modify some values
1561,1554735135.8514,Johna,oh? i’ll check that out; thanks!
1561,1554743082.8552,Sasha,"<@Johna> In the absence of a database, you could create the objects in a data structure. Like instead of having a separate variable for each one, use a dict where the objects are the values: `chars[name] = character(name=name, max_hp=hp)`."
1562,1554743140.8555,Sasha,So it's just a loop from reading the CSV file.

1563,1554748094.8846,Ashley,why highlight if you're scraping it anyway?; or is that just your means to point scrapy at the changing elements?
1563,1554748151.8854,Jolanda,Because I need a visual evidence of changes
1563,1554748166.8857,Hiroko,is that your requirement or someone else’s?

1563,1554749841.9034,Jolanda,"Yeah, the problem is generate the xpath using this style"
1563,1554749896.9043,Ashley,"you can rely on the indentation from the prettifying process; start at the line of the wrapping tag; then work your way up the file line by line; check the indentation, and if it matches the wrapping tag, then you know it's not the parent, but if it's the same indentation and tag name, then you can increase the count for that layer; if the indentation is more, then you can ignor the line, and if it's less, you have the parent; if it's less, you can then update the indentation amount you check for to be that; that'll build your xpath"

1576,1554785267.9573,Sasha,"One way to think about dicts versus classes for data-storage uses is: what sort of thing are the keys? If the keys are themselves data, coming from user input, or a file, or whatever, then you probably want a dict. If the keys are under your control as a programmer and are more or less fixed in your code, then you probably want a class instead.; That leaves aside the whole ""data plus functions acting on it"" angle, where you can gain from rolling together attributes and methods in a class."

```

If the response is the client instance with a changed state, it will be more tricky. But you can also test if the state was changed to the expected value

```
terminated_client = terminate(id)

assert ""terminated"" == terminated_client.status
```"

1587,1554827553.0082,Frankie,"Hi everyone. Is there a decent library or some solution for handling converting date strings of varying types to a consistent type? Specifically I'm pulling news from <http://newsapi.org|newsapi.org> and their timestamps vary ... some are in `2019-04-09T16:09:46.8946424+00:00` format, some are in regular `2019-04-09T16:09:46Z` format, some have varying milliseconds, nanoseconds, etc. I just want to be able to convert them all to eastern time. Is there any way other than building an if-statement for every possible format?"
1587,1554828003.0087,Joette,I'd at least take a look at Arrow <https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>; parsedatetime <https://pypi.org/project/parsedatetime/>
1587,1554828839.01,Frankie,thanks. fwiw they are all UTC time so I do know that; the issue is I don't know what format it will come in. I think even w/ arrow I will need to have a bunch of conditional logic to decide which function to use.
1588,1554829072.0123,Clemmie,Probably yes. In arrow anything that isn’t an ISO-8601 (and possibly some that are) will need the format provided.
1587,1554829140.0139,Clemmie,Time is hard - the real answer is to get in touch with newsapi and push for them to normalize their timestamps
1587,1554829151.0141,Annabell,"When would you use Flask (or Django) over just using CouchDB?

1588,1554829265.0167,Annabell,<@Clemmie>  : D true. Maybe just use Django at that point and its ORM.

1592,1554866680.0049,Sasha,It's the exclusive-or (XOR) bitwise operator. So `0b0101 ^ 0b0010 == 0b0111` in binary.

1593,1554872366.0091,Sasha,"The comma is essentially doing two assignments at once, so `a, b = b, a+b` is equivalent to:
```temp1 = b
temp2 = a+b
a = temp1
b = temp2```
But note that it's not quite equivalent to:
```a = b
b = a+b```
because you don't want `a` to be altered before its old value can be used in the second part."

1597,1554894939.0228,Conchita,I started working on some other people's code today (for the first time ever). One thing I see is that in one function they have added to `if` statements after eachother and no else block. My reflex is that the second `if` statement should be converted to `else`
1597,1554894999.0241,Jimmy,it depends what it does
1597,1554895008.0243,Conchita,"```
def foo():
    if x == 'poo':
         # do this
    if x == 'shoo':
         # do this```"
1597,1554895035.0247,Jimmy,"in this case it looks like it could be `if` &amp; `elif`; ```
if x % 2 == 0:
  # stuff
if x % 3 == 0:
  # stuff
```; in a case like that the behavior would change; because if `x ` is 6 it would execute both `if`"
1597,1554895203.0284,Conchita,Aha. Well in this case it's one or the other. What happens in the first `if` statement will never execute the second `if` statement
1597,1554895255.0291,Hiroko,not really; multiple `if` statements will execute if the conditions match; `if` and `elif` will execute only one of the many you can put in sequence; `else` will always execute if none of the others have; is that what you’re curious about?
1597,1554895361.0318,Conchita,"I meant that with the specific code I'm working on now, the conditions will only match with one of the `if` blocks."
1597,1554895431.0332,Hiroko,"ok, but can the params change to match the others?; you said its a function, are there arguments for the function?"
1598,1554895470.0342,Scot,"Thanks <@Sasha>,good explanation"
1597,1554895559.0357,Conchita,It takes in a JSON request and the `if` condition is checking the source of the post request (not sure if I'm using the correct terms here); ie `if request['source']['Slack'] == True` or `if request['source']['Discord'] == True`
1597,1554895691.0371,Hiroko,"ok.   so that function is flexible; you can pass in a json request from whatever sources it looks for and it’ll handle the thing with specific logic; if its not being used now, it could have been in the past or is anticipated to be used in the future"
1597,1554895866.0392,Conchita,"Gotcha, makes more sense now. Thanks for the help <@Jimmy> <@Hiroko> this is a :taco: One thing I'm learning in this process is that its much easier writing code than reading it lol"
1597,1554895875.0394,Hiroko,yep; but you might have had a similar experience if you look at your own code you wrote last year :slightly_smiling_face:; since all the details for the “why” are long gone from short term memory; lets just say I’ve had more than a few instances of “what idiot wrote this stuff?”  … said idiot was me; :smile:
1597,1554895949.042,Conchita,Exactly had this experience a few days ago when taking a look at the first script I made; hahaha
1597,1554895979.0429,Hiroko,thats why there’s such a focus on readability with code
1597,1554895982.0431,Conchita,Well my goal is to make future me think present me is a complete imbecile
1597,1554895992.0434,Hiroko,a very admirable one!
1597,1554896019.0438,Jimmy,I'd start to worry when that's not the case :smile:
1597,1554896033.044,Hiroko,yep; that’s when you start to fossilize and not keep growing in knowledge and competence; thinking you know everythign and don’t need to learn because it was tried 5 years ago and didn’t work is the worst place to be
1597,1554896094.0463,Conchita,I have this rule that if I can't remember something that I'm embarrassed about from the previous month I need to change something. Meaning I'm too relaxed with xyz; Ah one more thing; Is `if condition` the same as `if condition == True` equal?
1597,1554896207.0476,Jimmy,no; `if x` check that x is `thruthy`; a non-empty string would enter it for example
1597,1554896288.0488,Conchita,"""truthy"" lol"
1597,1554896298.049,Jimmy,yeah no idea how to say that :smile:
1597,1554896328.0496,Conchita,"So it checks that ""condition is not NaN""; ?"

1604,1554913059.0915,Claudine,oh god
1604,1554913068.0918,Elwanda,:joy::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
1604,1554913073.092,Claudine,sorry dog that's still unformatted
1604,1554913093.0926,Elwanda,what do you need so you can help me out; this is for a school project; thats y
1604,1554913119.0936,Claudine,"see the plus button on the left of where you're typing? hit that and click ""code or text snippet"" and post code in there; it formats it for readbaility"
1604,1554913128.0942,Elwanda,ok
1604,1554913141.0944,Claudine,nvm; your issue is you're missing a closing `)`
1604,1554913154.0949,Elwanda,None
1604,1554913160.0953,Claudine,the one immediately after your `elif` is not closed at the end
1604,1554913197.0955,Elwanda,should i close it after or ?
1604,1554913236.096,Claudine,"it seems like you're trying to wrap that whole thing, so i'd close it at the very end after `won a game"")`; ```
You originally typed:
elif  (button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button3 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button6 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button7 [""text""] == ""O"" and button8 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button3 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button7 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button7 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button8 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button3 [""text""] == ""O"" and button6 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
          tkinter.messagebox.showinfo(""Winner O"", ""You have just won a game"")

You probabaly want:
elif  (button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button3 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button6 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button7 [""text""] == ""O"" and button8 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button3 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button7 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button7 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button8 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button3 [""text""] == ""O"" and button6 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
          tkinter.messagebox.showinfo(""Winner O"", ""You have just won a game""))

1604,1554913293.0968,Elwanda,ok thanks man u saved my ass :joy:; its still showing invalid syntax :disappointed_relieved:
1604,1554913365.0976,Claudine,do you need a `:` at the end too? and to fill out that `elif` statement?
1604,1554913406.0978,Elwanda,no ithink so
1604,1554913464.0985,Claudine,"in th ebig chunk of unformatted code you posted there are two `elif` statements that do not have the `:` at the end; you have one of those statements, then
```
     #123
     #456
     #789
```
then a second"
1604,1554913492.0995,Elwanda,where should i put : ?
1604,1554913599.1013,Claudine,"see how before you did `elif buttons [""text""] == "" "" and click == False:`?
the `:` just means it's the end of the `if` or `elif` check and everything after is what your doing if that statement is true.
in the case of your broken code it goes in the same spot, just a bit confusing since that statment is spread across so many lines
the `:` would go here: `... won a game"")):`; everything in between the open parenthesis `elif (` and the closing parenthesis `game""))` is part of that same `elif`"
1604,1554913666.1021,Elwanda,now this problem i have
1604,1554913737.1025,Claudine,"yea that makes sense; see where you have:
```
   #123
   #456
   #789
```
those are commented out lines, so essentially the `elif` before those numbers has no body, so it doesn't expect to see another `elif`"
1604,1554913810.1039,Elwanda,so i remove it ?
1604,1554913815.1041,Claudine,"so you'd have to add some boyd logic to that first `elif`, even just a `print('hey') or something would work; if you remove it youll still have the problem, you just need some sort of operation or logic in between"
1604,1554913840.1049,Elwanda,like ?
1604,1554913865.1053,Claudine,"literally anything
`foo = 1`
`1 + 1`; `print()`"
1604,1554913878.1057,Elwanda,replace with elif right ?; wht about this ?
1604,1554913988.1062,Claudine,no; here....; None
1604,1554914009.1072,Genesis,Wow... I feel like there has got to be a better way to write that logic
1604,1554914024.1074,Claudine,What i posted was your original code
1604,1554914029.1077,Elwanda,oh k
1604,1554914031.1079,Claudine,you want to  make these updates:
1604,1554914034.1082,Elwanda,ok
1604,1554914094.1094,Genesis,What about `all([button['text'] == 'x' for button in buttons])`; Your entire if statement can be written like that :point_up:
1604,1554914116.1102,Elwanda,i thought of that. Will it work ? :point_up_2:
1604,1554914118.1103,Claudine,None
1604,1554914165.1118,Genesis,"You can also do 
```
If 'x' == button1 == button2 == buttton3:
```; No need for all the ands"
1604,1554914199.1127,Claudine,yea you can simplify a whole ton
1604,1554914268.1129,Elwanda,now it comes like this? Wht the heck is wrong
1604,1554914397.1139,Claudine,"the error message is correct, python requires very specific indenting"
1604,1554914419.1146,Elwanda,i am failing in my python project; :woman-facepalming::woman-facepalming::woman-facepalming::woman-facepalming:
1604,1554914431.1151,Claudine,"in this case you're doing

you need
```

    foo()
```; dont worry about it man :slightly_smiling_face:"
1604,1554914469.1161,Elwanda,None
1604,1554914495.1168,Claudine,"the body of an `if` or `elif` statements needs to be indented, python only knows the `if`/`elif` statement has ended when it sees stuff on the same indentation level as the `if`"
1605,1554914522.1173,Hiroko,why those indents below `buttons`?
1604,1554914524.1174,Claudine,whatcha doing with `buttons=StringVar ()` there that looks odd; all that stuff should be indented consistently
1604,1554914544.118,Elwanda,i am actually creating an game
1604,1554914574.1183,Claudine,do this:; None
1604,1554914636.1191,Elwanda,whats the change ?
1604,1554914641.1193,Claudine,"the indentation; see how they are all indented consistently?; in yours you have
```
buttons=...
    button1...
```
in this it's
```
buttons=...
button1...
```; python is strict about indentation"
1604,1554914709.121,Elwanda,ok; let me try
1604,1554914720.1215,Claudine,it was awkward for me at first too but once you get used to it it makes a lot of sense and keeps your code neat and readable
1604,1554914767.1218,Elwanda,still the same error is coming :disappointed_relieved:
1604,1554914833.1221,Claudine,oh it's because those all come right after the `elif` above that; if they are supposed to be part of that `elif` statment they need to be indented 1 level more than the `elif`
1604,1554914879.1233,Elwanda,so i should ?
1604,1554914885.1235,Claudine,if they are not supposed to part of the `elif` than you just need something in the body of the `elif`; im not 100% sure what your trying to do so it's hard to say. do you want to run all that `button` stuff from within the `elif` statement right above them? if so then indent them 1 level more than the elif. if they're not part of the elif then give the elif some body logic; it could help to brush up on some python tutorials about indentation and formatting too
1604,1554915012.1257,Elwanda,Do you know the game X and O?; i am making that
1604,1554915023.1263,Claudine,tic tac toe yea i saw it in your code
1604,1554915037.1267,Elwanda,yeah :joy::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
1604,1554915054.1271,Claudine,"im also just trying to point you in the right direction so you recognize your own mistakes, rather than just give you correct code"
1604,1554915072.1273,Elwanda,oh..; yeah
1604,1554915078.1277,Claudine,:smile:; i dont wanna do your homework for you :smile:

1604,1554915356.1296,Claudine,lol i dunno dude. let me rephrase what I said and walk you through it again; oh you got it?
1604,1554915360.13,Elwanda,yeahh....; but i prob; when i run it
1604,1554915395.1309,Claudine,i mean step 1 is getting it to actually run so thats great

1604,1554915439.132,Claudine,well that's a pretty straightforward error isn't it? it's telling you that no such thing as `T1` exists; did you define something called `T1` in your file?
1604,1554915459.1325,Elwanda,wait let me see; tk = t1; tk = t1(); i did this; its suppose to be tk not tl; i am soo dumb :joy:

My issue is this : The Pi comes with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 pre-installed. From what i can see ""pip"" is also installed by default, so...

I have installed some flask packages ( modules ?? ) with pip install &lt;package&gt;, but unbeknownst to me, when i tried to import some flask modules using the Python3 interpreter ( think that's what you call it ), it complains that those packages cannot be imported as they don't ""exist"". My research led me to understand that pip installed the packages to the Python 2.7 site-packages folder instead of the site-packages for python3 ( as this is my default interpreter ). I verified that this was the case by running :

pip show &lt;package name&gt;

So my question is - how do i now move these packages from the Python 2.7 site-packages folder to the Python3 site-packages folder, and then force pip to install all future packages inside Python3's site-packages folder ?

1637,1555062822.0282,Wilber,Can you post the code where you call `publish`?; If its being called as a class method then it will be automatically passing the class instance as the first argument
1636,1555063070.0303,Conchita,"The first snippet above is where I call publish, the second snippet is the code of the whole publish.py script. Neither is using classes <@Wilber>; Do you want the whole code from where I call the `publish.py`?"
1636,1555063187.0321,Wilber,yeah
1636,1555063265.0322,Conchita,None; (its a mess)
1636,1555063601.034,Wilber,Ah probably has to do with how google functions is calling it then? Sorry I'm not familiar with them.  Does the error give a stack trace? You can also try adding an argument to your `publish` method and then logging it to see what its expecting
1636,1555063976.0348,Conchita,Yeah this stuff is a bit confusing. I'll try a few different approaches here
1636,1555064254.0354,Wilber,"Oh, my assumption is that when google functions is trying to run the function it always passes the `request` argument; So you might need to define the publish function with that argument (like it is with `run`)"

Has someone successfully pointed Pycharm to Bitbucket? I cannot get it to work. I can connect to Bitbucket with Git but with Pycharm,"
1642,1555089666.0765,Dayna,Are you looking for more than the git integration (meaning there is some deeper integration your are looking for)? It should just read your local git directory for changes/diffs/conflicts.; There are some older issues on the JetBrains issue tracker about using non-RSA private keys: <https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000124604-PyCharm-Bitbucket-Could-not-read-from-remote-repository>
1642,1555089851.0782,Enid,<@Dayna> When I try to push from Pycharm nothing happens. If I push from Git bash things work.
1642,1555089872.0786,Dayna,"""nothing happens"", can you find the logs? There should be some report if problem somewhere you can read"
1642,1555090183.0792,Enid,I will check the logs. I might ping you later if I can get it to work. Thank you for the suggestion.
1641,1555090677.0793,Nenita,why does this not work? It doesn't update the variables in the list?
1642,1555090812.0805,Clemmie,nope. It has to do with how python handles references and immutable objects
1641,1555090841.081,Clemmie,"but what are you really trying to do? - that is a toy example, and the real case may have a workable solution"
1641,1555090906.0821,Sasha,"Line 5 is equivalent to `my_list = ['', '', '']` because the list holds the contents of the variable, not the variable name."
1641,1555090944.0829,Nenita,"i have 12 headers that are variable names to store the values that will be appended in the latter portion. I made a list containing the variable names (not their values) which then store the values, but it doesn't seem to like this method."
1641,1555090979.0837,Clemmie,"stick them into a single dict, change the values in the dict, and grab the changed values  when needed; so at anytime your list is a call to dict.values()"
1641,1555091053.0852,Nenita,"<@Clemmie> that would work. thanks. <@Sasha> thanks for the info. that makes sense.; i figured it would update the values in the list, but i guess not."
1641,1555091148.0866,Clemmie,"when you find yourself doing something with a group of objects, you should think about using the  container types"
1641,1555091285.087,Nenita,"container types being?: dictionary, lists, etc?"

1641,1555091521.0896,Nenita,per that link - random question here - but i saw 'if key in mapping'. Does the keyword 'in' work like enumerate or like a dictionary pointer(dict[key])?
1641,1555091929.0913,Clemmie,that formula asks “is the value held by `key` in the iterable `mapping`
1641,1555091985.0921,Nenita,i see
1641,1555092004.0927,Sasha,"The behavior can vary depending on what `mapping` is. If it's an iterable, it'll loop through and see whether one of the values is equal to `key`. If it's a dict, it will directly see whether `key` is one of the keys in the dict."
1641,1555092033.0932,Nenita,ah thanks. that definitely clears the fog up
1641,1555092145.0941,Sasha,"(And sets are in the middle... it'll directly see whether one of the set values is `key`, without needing to iterate.)"
1641,1555092203.0944,Nenita,thats nice
1641,1555092571.0948,Clemmie,yeah- i hand waved over a dict returning the iterable of keys -sorry

1644,1555095102.0977,Sasha,"Probably, yeah. There's also `functools.partial`, which can construct a new function that has some parameters already fixed."
1641,1555097789.1002,Jorge,"If i have an `_io.BufferedRandom` object, I'm iterating over it, and each time i iterate over it i'd like to copy the original.

1645,1555097974.1011,Sasha,I'm not quite sure I follow... that should be a random-access stream where you can `seek()` back to the start if you want to.
1645,1555098043.1024,Nenita,is there a simple method of rounding timestamps to the hour? i.e. 3:48:52pm --&gt; 3pm

1645,1555098089.1038,Jorge,"yea, during the ""saving"" process, I jump back to the beginning of the `_io.BufferedRandom` object and dump the contents to a TextField in a database.
so i kind of lose my spot, and after the first iteration, i'm at the end of the file
so my plan was to save a copy of the object each time"

1645,1555098140.1055,Claudine,you could also just trim to the first `:`; or use the datetime library they have conversions

1646,1555100180.1114,Sasha,"If you're doing a SQL query, then `GROUP BY` is probably your friend."
1646,1555100212.112,Nenita,well for a much data as i am going to be pushing (about 1 million sales) i want to use python because its more flexable
1646,1555100279.1135,Sasha,Then `collections.Counter()` is probably your friend.
1646,1555100295.1138,Clemmie,what flexibility do you need? for this sort of question SQL sure sounds like the right ansewer

1646,1555100346.1152,Nenita,"well i have 11 locations to filter, about 50 items to filter, and about 1+ mil sales. the query will take forever and i wont be able to do anything with the data other than was sql allows"
1646,1555100352.1154,Joette,if not SQL - which would be the first thing I'd reach for too - then Pandas
1646,1555100380.1161,Nenita,pandas is my best friend. i just am trying to figure a good formula that i can just shove all the data into.
1646,1555100408.1168,Joette,though if the query is taking forever that suggests other issues (e.g. indexing) and not the DB per se
1646,1555100424.1179,Nenita,"i did this to step by step figure out what the best method would be; yea, our db is setup with ms access over firebird odbc and ms access is a pain, but effective.; and sometimes when i run queries on certain tables, access just crashes so im looking to avoid that all together"
1646,1555100478.1199,Joette,"... I cannot remember the method/function but Pandas does have a facility for aggregating by say, the hour, of a timestamp in a column; I spent a lot of time researching how to do it but then abandoned it b/c it wasn't the right fit for what I was working on"
1646,1555100535.121,Nenita,"but with this screenshot, i dont even know if i am doing the math right"
1646,1555100566.1216,Joette,in Excel I'd create a column extracting the hour from each time and then use a PivotTable

I'm not sure how it works, so I think of this scenario, assuming Slack here is Telegram one-on-one private chat:

I'm texting you now, this message gets sent to the Telegram server(and the government maybe?), then to your client and it appears almost immediately as if it wasn't routed to any intermediaries. Your Telegram client picks it up almost immediately I send it here. How do you think your Telegram client gets the message? Does it *probe/poke* the Telegram server on timely basis checking for any updates or does the Telegram server just notify the client app magically? I mean sort of like how `conditional_variable::wait()` and `::notify()` works locally when used with mutexes from different threads."
1652,1555136285.1558,Serina,"Hi! I'd really appreciate your help.
I am new to python and was trying to write unit tests. I am kind of stuck trying to mock user input. Is there something I am missing?
This is what my code looks like:

```
class GetInput:

    def __init__(self):
        self.key1 = os.environ['key1']
        self.key2 = os.environ['key2']
        self.fruits = []

    def get(self):

                user_input = self.fruit_input()
                if user_input == 'apple':
                    print('you entered apple')
                    return

                self.fruits.append(user_input)

    def fruit_input(self):
        user_input = input('Enter Fruit')
        return user_input

rs = GetInput()
rs.get()

```

Test Cases:
```
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from fruit import GetInput

class FruitTest(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('fruit.GetInput.fruit_input', return_value='apple')
    def test_user_input(self, input):

```"
1652,1555136539.1567,Sasha,"So one thing that looks weird is `GetInput.get()`, since you're calling it like a class method. You should probably create an object, like `GetInput().get()`."
1652,1555136817.1568,Serina,"I did that <@Sasha>; This is what it throws

1652,1555137064.1578,Sasha,"I agree, that's definitely going to be wrong in your patch. You probably want `'fruit.GetInput.fruit_input'` there, but I'm not 100% sure."

This is how my patch looks like

1652,1555137603.1589,Sasha,"You may want to ask for further help in #testing_, as this is probably an easy question for someone more familiar with mocks.; You might need `patch.object()`, for instance."

a = patch.object()

@a('fruit.GetInput.get.self.fruit_input', return_value='apple')"

1655,1555157945.172,Erika,i'm trying to build an Android App with python. it's working on my Mac but building the APK is giving me alot of issues; what is the most reliable way to build an Android App with python? like a Hello World example?
1655,1555157996.1732,Monica,"what do you mean, specifically?

Well, what aspect of Python are you using?"
1655,1555158111.1746,Erika,"i'm currently using Buidozer and python-for-android to build my Python code into an App. I'm completely new to mobile development so any guidance/tips would be awesome :slightly_smiling_face:; I don't know what I don't know, if that makes sense?"
1655,1555158145.1756,Monica,I know exactly what you mean
1655,1555158169.1761,Erika,"I'm a data scientist and mathematician, used to backend algorithms; hehe for now I just want an Android app that says 'hello world' on a phone :slightly_smiling_face:; i'm willing to learn any framework/package to make that happen :slightly_smiling_face:"
1655,1555158254.1779,Monica,"to be honest, if you're struggling with it, I would consider trying out Expo/React; it's a framework that reminds of Ruby on Rails for mobile apps. Really easy to get an app testable on Android. You'll see what I mean"
1655,1555158361.1802,Erika,i understand what you are saying; okay so here is a stupid question:
1655,1555158378.1812,Monica,sorry I should have said Expo + React Native
1655,1555158389.1815,Erika,how do I use a python class in a Java application?
1655,1555158400.1818,Monica,what do you need it to do?
1655,1555158443.1826,Erika,apologies I can't disclose sensitive IP; but essetially
1655,1555158457.1833,Monica,"I don't need the IP.; Just a 30,000 foot view"

1655,1555158571.1869,Monica,"When it comes to opencv, you're asking for some real hell if you try to use it outside of a Python script; but the other things ..."
1655,1555158588.1873,Erika,hehehe i assumed as much
1655,1555158596.1877,Monica,the others aren't nearly as bad
1655,1555158602.1878,Erika,that's why i was pushing for a native python app
1655,1555158607.1881,Monica,Gotcha; that makes sense; and that's why I was asking; is OpenCv crucial to your application?
1655,1555158631.189,Erika,yes
1655,1555158647.1893,Monica,"ok, in that case, scrap what I said about Expo + React"
1655,1555158670.1897,Erika,"hehe; i think a good start would be to say hello world and then I can take it from there; so I can learn the python build pipeline, you know?; so let me rephrase the question:"
1656,1555158755.1919,Erika,what is the easiest and most reliable way to package a hello word for Android? Written in native python?
1655,1555158843.1936,Erika,"I know that I am going to end up devving a custom solution away, i just need a base that works"
1655,1555158924.195,Monica,"as a python developer, I haven't written any code for android, so I'm definitely not the best to answer that question.

As a general rule, the further you get from creating a to-do list, the more fundamental software development knowledge you will need. An android app with CV capability is about as far as you can get from it.

I see that buildozer has an installation guide. Have you followed at least those steps?"
1655,1555159010.1961,Erika,i have downloaded the buildozer and python-for-anroid master branches but keep having to alter the source code to move past building and config errors
1655,1555159053.1971,Monica,did you make sure you're running python 3?
1655,1555159054.1972,Erika,"so i'm running two projects parralel:
project 1: Buildozer and p4a route
project 2: any alternative method; yeah python3 all the way; i'll get the buildozer approach working eventually, but I just feel like somewhere there has to be a better way. what are other devs doing? you know?"
1655,1555159177.2,Monica,"I would expect other devs to write the Android app in Java, since that's the main language for the android platform and it also has OpenCV api in Java"
1655,1555159208.2006,Erika,"""and it also has OpenCV api in Java"" -- this makes my life easier"
1655,1555159223.2009,Monica,"it would probably be less work in the long run for you to learn Java than to try to sort this out in Python; ^ that may sound crazy, but I'm telling you that from experience"
1655,1555159255.2018,Erika,"i know java well etc. I want to take the route that minimises technical debt, you know?"
1655,1555159287.2025,Monica,"always go with the more documented option when doing nontrivial things the first time. There are just way too many things you have no way of knowing otherwise.; Have you looked at these?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMHK6NDVlCM>"
1655,1555159428.204,Erika,"hehe yeah I have thanks. most of them don't reference package the app itself, and those who do reference packaging, do so very high level"
1655,1555159449.2048,Monica,"yeah, I would just do it in Java then"
1655,1555159459.2051,Erika,"thanks :slightly_smiling_face:; thanks for advising, you are always more than welcome to send any code/problems my way to solve. I know 13 coding languages and have written 1"

How would I install Numpy without pip?; in a way that it'd be packaged with the embedded distribution?"
1655,1555161871.2083,Raven,"Depends a bit on what this ""embedded distribution"" is"
1655,1555161969.2088,Erika,"hmm that sounds like a difficult one; pip is just a package manager, so go look at pip source code and determine how to do it manually?; probably like one or two lines that need to be altered?; my 2 cents"
1655,1555162277.2109,Monica,"say for example, I want to have access to numpy in my ED. What do I need to do to accomplish that?"
1655,1555162353.2117,Erika,damn that's a hard question. i'm going to look into it and come back to you?
1655,1555162357.2118,Monica,"and how would one do an embedded distribution for a platform besides windows; they have the .zip for windows, but it contains a .exe"
1655,1555162404.2131,Raven,Most Python environments have a `Lib\site-packages` directory. 3rd party packages like Numpy live in there.
1655,1555162470.2135,Erika,yeah but those site-packages need to be built dont they?; like setup.py build ?; or am I wrong?
1655,1555162515.2147,Monica,the ED .zip archive for windows doesn't have that dir in there
1655,1555162523.215,Raven,Mostly they're just plain packages
1655,1555162552.2153,Monica,ok; why does windows have a very clear way to do ED and Mac doesn't?

1657,1555164255.2284,Erika,yeah :slightly_smiling_face:
1657,1555164257.2286,Gia,And use python native; I do have psycharm on my laptop; I never done that before

1657,1555164330.2327,Erika,trying to build a pipeline from non-relational straight to powerbi will provide too much of a technical debt

1657,1555164359.2335,Gia,Yea if you saw this file it is nested
1657,1555164372.2338,Erika,ah yeah then you don't want that; you need  an intermediary step to flatten
1657,1555164386.2346,Gia,Opening pycharm; Can I have python create a csv file ; Oh I forgot I got sql express on this laptop
1657,1555164422.236,Erika,"if you don't  have a db at hand, then unflatten into dataframe and save as csv's with df.to_csv('file.csv')"
1657,1555164442.2363,Gia,Cool

1657,1555164461.2375,Erika,but if i were you i would try and avoid powerbi without a db
1657,1555164479.2379,Gia,Okay I will use sql express
1657,1555164521.2387,Erika,what is your main goal?
1657,1555164528.2391,Gia,My main goal is this; And also a map
1657,1555164579.2398,Erika,no more high level please; like you would explain to your grandmother
1657,1555164593.2407,Gia,Okay
1657,1555164594.2408,Erika,then we can go low level from there

1657,1555164748.2452,Gia,Ahh yea sorry; That fine I totally forgot the rules
1657,1555164756.2458,Erika,if it is for your work then we need to speak legalities
1657,1555164767.2461,Gia,Yea I can’t say much ; But I will use pycharm to flat it; Thanks for the tips; Sorry
1657,1555164841.2477,Erika,it's okay :slightly_smiling_face:; and pleasure for the tips

1657,1555165044.2512,Erika,"have you used sql server manager before?; where you would say ""select top 10 * from table with (nolock)"" ?"
1657,1555165070.252,Gia,Yea I have
1657,1555165082.2523,Erika,okay now when you execute it in sql server manager; you automatically login to the db
1657,1555165097.253,Gia,Yea
1657,1555165101.2533,Erika,you parse a string to the server; the server reads it and spits out the results
1657,1555165114.2539,Gia,Yea
1657,1555165128.2543,Erika,"now in the same way, you can connect to ANY sql server from python; and send a string to it; the connection is called a *odbc* connection; you will need pyodbc; and look at Microsoft docs on how to set up a odbc connection between your python environment and the SQL server"
1657,1555165225.2562,Gia,Ahh I see; Thanks for the tip

1659,1555168431.2576,Cammie,"Can someone help me out with a random coding problem? I swear this is easy and I'm just being stupid.

I have dates that are in this format:

`2013.500`

The portion to the left of the `.` is the year. This is good. The portion to the right of the `.` is the percentage into the year, by month. So for example this says we're `50`% through the year, so we'd figure out that that means month 6 of of 12, or June.

I need to write a method to convert that fractional value to the month,. where just the numerical representation of the month is great [1-12].; Came up with:

```
def month_decimal_to_index(s: str):
    """"""Converts the weird encoding deciaml that this data set had to an actual month.
    EX: '2013.250' -&gt; 3, for March, the third month of the year
    
    """"""
    DECIMAL_VALUE_PER_MONTH = 1.00/12
    return float('.' + s.split('.')[1])//DECIMAL_VALUE_PER_MONTH + 1 # we reattach the '.' we split on, as it is a decimal and we want to use it
```"
1659,1555169748.2585,Raven,In what way does your attempt not work?
1659,1555169890.2597,Sasha,"A handy trick is to use the modulus operator to get the fractional part of a float, so `(float(s) % 1) * 12` would give you the month."
1660,1555169924.2603,Sasha,"However, the representation is a little weird. If 0.500 is supposed to be June, how is December specified?"
1659,1555170058.2619,Raven,"A more accurate approach, depending on what exactly the fraction means, might be to work out if it's a leap year, to multiply that fractional part by 365 or 366 accordingly, add that number of days to a datetime object for Jan 1st of that year, then extract the month"
1660,1555175014.2625,Stan,"<@Bruna>

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(values)
[u'Country', u'Invoice required for Ancillary Supply Import License?', u'Notification of shipment to be provided to (AS)']
```

`[d[1] for d in data]` This is called a list-comprehension. Look it up. `d` in `data` refers to  a tuple like `('A1', u'Country')`. Within `d`, `d[0]` would be `A1` and `d[1]` would be `Country`.

The whole logic enclosed in `[..]` is building a new list with results (hence ""comprehension"")."

You'd want one of these when you want to modify something in-place (or you just want read-only access to it, no modifications needed). You want a deep copy of something when you need to modify the new copy, but retain the old copy as it was at the time of the copy (or do something else to modify it that won't affect the new copy).; Shallow copies are great for when you've got a gigantic object in memory, and you don't want to make copies of it for no good reason.; Deep copies are good for when you want to keep concurrent, independent copies of an object that can be modified at-will without affecting each other."

but also, with that, I was wondering if this is also possible to do on a Mac? I noticed that Python has embedded distributions that are downloadable as a zip, and contain an exe, but I'm surprised they don't just have it ready to go for a Mac as well, unless I'm missing something?"
1662,1555190805.2777,Carmen,"That's because Mac is Linux-based, so AFAIK typically they have a system Python included already.; For values of linux-based anyway."

1662,1555191049.2806,Hiroko,<@Hai> have you looked in the groovy docs?
1662,1555191066.2812,Monica,"&gt; That's because Mac is Linux-based, so AFAIK typically they have a system Python included already.

So that means that I should be able to use something like `pip` just by using a mac right?"
1662,1555191068.2814,Hiroko,"also, not sure you’ll get any response here because its a fairly niche JVM language, and this is a python community; <@Monica> might help if you describe exactly what you’re trying to do; right now, I have little idea of what you’re trying to do, or how its supposed to work?"

1662,1555191263.2865,Monica,"<@Hiroko> yeah. I am building an electron desktop app and part of it relies on Python, so I want to have a way to package python 3.6 with Numpy + other things installed when the app itself is installed"
1662,1555191296.2871,Hiroko,js + electron + python + numpy?; that sounds like an unholy mess to get going
1662,1555191328.2886,Monica,"it works on a machine where all these things exist as they should already, but I don't want the user to have to go look for things and open their terminal to install, so I'm trying to bundle it all together for them; &gt; that sounds like an unholy mess to get going

1662,1555191396.291,Hiroko,"if its a desktop app, why not use one of the python gui frameworks?"
1662,1555191420.292,Monica,I like node :disappointed:
1662,1555191429.2925,Hiroko,sounds like you’ll have similar issues if you go to java/swing/etc

1662,1555191503.295,Monica,"<@Carmen> yeah, I'm looking at that. It contains a lot of `.pyc` files. Not entirely sure how this relates to the modules"
1662,1555191522.2956,Carmen,`.pyc` files are just python scripts that have been compiled.
1662,1555191528.296,Hiroko,pyc == compiled python bytecode

1662,1555191611.2979,Monica,"so I need to compile a module to bytecode and put it in the `python36` folder is all, correct?; <@Hiroko> do you know if the python GUI frameworks allow for good cross-platform development?"
1662,1555191672.2988,Hiroko,take a look at Calibre; its a pretty good desktop application for managing ebooks on a computer; that’s all written in python; <https://calibre-ebook.com/>
1662,1555191793.3001,Monica,I used that when I wrote my novels!; didn't know that!
1662,1555191873.302,Carmen,"Realistically, I'd assume the modules should mostly already be pre-compiled. If not, yeah, you'll want to compile them down to bytecode."
1662,1555191875.3022,Monica,the reason I was using electron is because I already get it. And it's easy to upgrade the UX of the app. I don't have that kind of faith in the many python GUI frameworkds

1662,1555193190.3057,Sasha,It's a mix of hex escape characters plus some regular ASCII ones.
1666,1555193304.3068,Priscilla,"`x1bd001` is the hex
`\n` and `\` are escape
and `b'` are the ASCII right?"
1666,1555193372.3079,Sasha,"No, the `\xNN` pattern has only two hex digits in it. So it's parsed as `\x1b ""d001"" \x02 \x1b ""h00""`, etc."
1666,1555193405.3081,Priscilla,"oh; any idea what &lt;STX&gt; could stand for? other similar things in brackets are line feeds, carriage returns, and escape. &lt;STX&gt; ring any bells?"

&gt; Third-party packages should be installed by the application installer alongside the embedded distribution. Using pip to manage dependencies as for a regular Python installation is not supported with this distribution,

okay, so that is effectively saying, 3rd-party packages should be installed without using `pip`.  Then, regarding Embedding Python, which is what I am doing, it says:

&gt; packages can be installed to any location as there is an opportunity to specify search paths before initializing the interpreter. Otherwise, there is no fundamental differences between using the embedded distribution and a regular installation.; oh and it also says ...
&gt;  extracting the embedded distribution to a subdirectory of the application installation is sufficient to provide a loadable Python interpreter.; Alright. So I need to install a Third-party package alongside the embedded distribution, but without using `pip`. Cool. I'll look around for how to do that; I'm going to try this; <https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operating-mode.html>"

1677,1555250976.3348,Frankie,"Good morning everyone. Anybody wanna take a stab at helping me resolve what I think is a circular import problem in a django app? I'll have to share a bunch of code so didn't wanna flood the chat; I think it's just bad the way I've designed it so I'm trying to rearrange things a bit; basically the problem is I have an API which I built as a project app, which supplies all the data for my site and it uses DRF. However, I also have a blog app, which uses wagtail, which also uses DRF. So I had to do some custom permissions magic cause Wagtail was trying to send its API requests through my personal API's custom permissions classes, and now I've got a permissions module in my API app which I need in my `settings.py`, but the permissions module requires some things out of `settings.py` to determine the permissions. Lol; Here is some relevant info if it helps.

My API's *custom_permissions.py:*
```
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission
from rest_framework.exceptions import MethodNotAllowed
from django.conf import settings

CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = settings.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS
CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = settings.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS

class IsPremium(BasePermission):
    """"""
    API restriction to premium users only.
    """"""
    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        # Do stuff w/ variables from above to determine permissions
```

*settings/base.py:*
```
import os, sys

# For local dev
if os.environ.get('DJANGO_ENV') == 'DEV':
    from . import env_dev as env
else:
    from . import env

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'apps'))

# Env settings
SECRET_KEY = env.SECRET_KEY
DEBUG = env.DEBUG
... other vars
CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_FREE_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_TICKERS
CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS = env.CURRENT_LANDING_PAGE_VALID_INDICATORS
CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS = env.CURRENT_VALID_REFERERS

# Custom permissions for personal API
from lfa_lite.apps.api.permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium

# ... other settings

# Default DRF stuff for Wagtail to segregate it from my API
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    )
}

# For my personal API. Checks both IsAuthenticated as well as custom stuff
LFA_API_SETTINGS = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        IsPremium,
    )
}
```

Snippet of my API's *views.py*:
```
from rest_framework.viewsets import ViewSet
from rest_framework.decorators import action
from django.conf import settings

# Get default perms from settings, so I can change it in only one place if needed, or add more perms
LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = settings.LFA_API_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES']

class SomeViewSet(ViewSet):
    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do stuff

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_other_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do other stuff

class OtherViewSet(ViewSet):
    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_different_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do different stuff

    @action(methods=['post'], detail=False)
    def some_other_different_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do other different stuff

# ... lots more ViewSets and APIViews
```

The actual issue is that when I launch it into my staging environment on AWS (elastic beanstalk) the `SECRET_KEY` is coming back as empty, I think because the circular dependency is causing it to fail loading the settings. In staging, I use a staging.py settings file which basically is just `from base import *` and adds a few other variables for AWS and my live database and stuff.; So it turns out if I remove the `IsPremium` import from base.py and the one setting that uses it, and instead import `IsPremium` directly into custom_permissions.py, the app deploys normally but fails data migrations. That's a different problem, but I'm still wondering if anyone can see a way to be able to control the default permissions class in settings.py instead of having to do it in the API views like this:

```
from .permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium
LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = (IsPremium,)
```

It would just be nice to have a single place to manage everything where the settings for DRF already live. :man-shrugging:"
1678,1555261075.3504,Hai,None; what is the format of the output?

1678,1555261719.3575,Hai,yaa its my mistake i was just curious if someone know's groovy
1678,1555261740.3579,Frankie,no worries. I thought this was strictly for python help but I guess I could be wrong.

1679,1555276914.3631,Reanna,"Hi guys. Anyone familiar with django internationalization? I'm getting some weird behavior in my views.py:

1679,1555277246.3659,Reanna,"Yes, the middleware is included and in the correct location. Url language prefixes are functional so the middleware must be working.."
1679,1555277261.3663,Hiroko,"gotcha; having `activate` not persist across requests is probably standard behavior; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/#explicitly-setting-the-active-language>; &gt;&gt;&gt;You’ve already been introduced to django.utils.translation.activate(). That applies to the current thread only. To persist the language for the entire session, also modify LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY in the session:; &gt;&gt;&gt;You would typically want to use both: django.utils.translation.activate() will change the language for this thread, and modifying the session makes this preference persist in future requests."
1679,1555277392.3685,Reanna,"I see. So now this is quite strange... the session has the corrent language set, but gettext() always uses the default language - this is the bug I'm originally trying to solve.; And translation.get_language() is also not correct...

1684,1555327927.403,Hiroko,here is as good as any
1684,1555328107.4032,Leida,"alright :smile:; The problem:
```Create a programme that uses any text file with random content as an input, and checks all the words contained in such text file for letter combinations consisting of more than 3 letters.
Programme output will consist in up to 10 most common letter combinations and their difference in percentage displayed as a table and a bar chart.
```; Sample solution:```
The content of the input file:
hall feels heels
Output:
Frequencies:
eels: 28.57%
feel: 14.29%
heel: 14.29%
hall: 14.29%
feels: 14.29%
heels: 14.29%
```; My solution:```
1. Character stream -&gt; 2. word detector and input buffer -&gt; 3. combinations finder -&gt; 4. storage. -&gt; End of file -&gt; 5. sorting -&gt; 6. table/graph output.

1. Character stream.
Reads the file one character at a time.

2. Word detector and input buffer.
Has internal memory for several characters. When an invalid character is received the buffer is reset to empty. When there are 4 or more characters in the buffer, the contents of the buffer are emited to the next function in the pipeline. Even after emitting, the contents are kept. Only invalid characters reset the buffer.

3. Combinations finder.
The received word is the first combination. It gets emitted into the following function. Remove the first character in the word. If the length is atleast 4 emit that too. Keep removing the first letter and emitting until there are less than 4 characters. 

4. Storage.
Stores the combination and the occurance count. If the combination exists add 1 to the counter. If it doesnt exist set it to 1. After adding each occurance add 1 to total counter.

End of file reached.

5. Sorting.
Read through the stored data and keep track of the 10 most used combinations.

6. Print table and diagram.
Table - each row is the combination + the occurance percentage. Percentage is the number of occurances/total combinations * 100%.
Diagram can be an ascii of |-------. Percentage * “-” as the bar.
Both need some formating to look nice.
```; The goal is to optimize it to the max, handle all the errors and general showing off of skills ^^"

<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>"
1685,1555331370.4097,Leida,so `split()` should be replaced by some `tokenize()`; umm i think i have seen it used in the wild but in general if you have a function in a file that needs some imports but its never used then why have the function?; what happens when you try to import again?; wouldnt that incur some overhead?
1685,1555331973.4129,Jimmy,import are cached so not really; but I think it's considered good practice to have all imports at the same place (the top); I could see an use case if importing a module takes a lot of time otherwise meh
1685,1555332046.4144,Conchita,The functions are there because they are sometime used
1685,1555332056.4149,Jimmy,because you'll need to duplicate import for each function to be sure it's imported there; so more work for almost no gain
1685,1555332096.4161,Conchita,Yes someone linked me the pep-8 guide where it states you should have all imports in the first lines; Yep it does say that! Thanks!
1685,1555332860.4169,Hiroko,"the only case I can see using imports locally in a function is if you’re doing something with async tasks that don’t get called frequently; I would also say that its a negative for readability and knowing what stuff is being used; for example, you have a file with lots of functions in it that are dedicated to a thing.  If you continually import locally, you get lots of duplicated imports"
1685,1555333026.4192,Jonas,"The other case is if you have circular imports; which happens in some specific cases that are hard to avoid. But in general, no, please don't do that kind of import :smile: Add them to the top."
1685,1555333136.421,Renay,if you have circular imports you ought to look at refactoring your code. There are ways around it
1685,1555333142.4211,Jonas,I think you want <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product> for tha; not always unfortunately :disappointed:; and in some cases refactoring the code is worse; you end up splitting your code out in illogical places just to avoid it; but in general your approach is sound <@Leida>. Try and code it and we can give more feedback
1685,1555333408.4232,Leida,thank you for taking a look!
1686,1555337027.4318,Hildegard,"Meh. In C-like languages, declaring all variables at the top of the scope used to be required, then it held on as a style guide rule, and then finally fell out of favor a long time ago. Because declaring names close to the point of use is useful. Python imports are a similar mechanism, so the PEP8 rule always seemed wrong as a hard rule. Prefer the top, but don't insist on it."
1687,1555337179.4329,Hiroko,"problem I see with that is when you’re declaring at points of multiple usage, the scope of the import doesn’t bubble up; so you end up having to import the same thing multiple times; and whats the “point of usage”?; that can work the first time around for a simple thing, but I can see that being a pain in the butt for a larger project"
1686,1555337627.4383,Hildegard,"Sure, so the widely used ones go at the top. In general, doing a good job at organizing will probably lead to that. But maybe in a less critical script I'm defining a CLI at the bottom and that's where I want argparse and sys if that's the only place I need it"

I had a go using itertools to enumerate all possible swaps, and no equation is correct. But then I realised you can move digits rather than swap them: ie. `654 + 3 = 21`; So my question is: How would you solve this in Python? There has to be an elegant way, but it's escaping me"

1689,1555343921.4644,Nicholle,"Thanks, that makes sense. I think my problem is that I'm coming from languages with a _de-facto_ package management system (`npm`, `cargo`, `stack`, etc), and I'm finding that python doesn't have a _standard_ per se, and there are benefits and disadvantages to each approach."
1689,1555344282.4646,Lance,"Well, in Python the package manager is pip.

1708,1555454425.0541,Pasquale,Start by trying to solve some real world problems.  Automate some tasks on your computer.    As for how long it takes - that is very much dependent on the individual.  Since you have no programming experience it will take longer than someone who knows other languages.   A good way to get practical experience is to help answer questions on Stack Overflow or <http://Codementor.io|Codementor.io>.  That experience will make you dig deep and provide some pre-job experience.

1709,1555463424.072,Eliana,"<@Isabel> It depends on a number of things which makes it really hard to pin down a number of years. I taught myself python when i was already working as a database administrator. I used python on the job off and on for ~3 years and then moved to a developer role. This hints at what <@Pasquale> was saying about solving real world problems. This can be difficult for someone who may not have real world business problems to get the “trigger time”. These problems are also unique to particular areas like web development, networking, databases, analytics, data science, etc. This is when the beauty of open-source comes into play. If I had to start all over and go from “zero to hero” this would be my plan of attack.

1. Understand that software development is a craft like any other. The old saying goes, “It’s the journey not the destination”. It builds from basic concepts to more advanced ones and requires time and dedication.
2. Become really good at the basics. Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, if/then, for/while loops .etc. Figure out different ways to use these. They will be the things that drag you down later on if you don’t have a good understanding of them.
3. Find a community like this one to ask questions and talk with real programmers. Lose the ego. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and be curious. Feel the need to tinker and break things. Failure == learning. Be relentless in your pursuit to learning.
4. Read source code as much as you can. Find the really good projects and study the code line by line. Take it apart, reverse engineer, and learn the inner workings.
5. Find an open source project to contribute to. We have community projects here btw. This gives you experience with working with version control in a collaborative manner. You also have something to point to in a resume. Being a developer is SO much more than just producing code. There is testing, communication, collaboration, reading other’s code, etc.
6. Rinse and repeat."

I got a job 5 months after I started and spent no more than $15 on the education; But lots and lots of hours; 1. Build stuff you find useful or fun, and *see those projects through* - finish them. They must be hosted on github + preferably host the app on a website
2. contribute to open source (doesn't have to be code)
3. Study tutorials, code of projets like request, pandas etc
4. Try to spend at least 30-60 min to write and read code every single day; 5. Focus heavily on as few technologies and modules as possible in the beginning (Don't use selenium, request, bs4, pandas, json, mongodb etc in your first projects) Start very small, and improve your projects little by little
6. Dont give up; I focused mainly on building scrapers and that seemed to be a nice intro to everyhting; I also built a sentiment analysis tool that listened to all tweets globally containing a keyword (complex) which costed me a looot of time and I was very slow to debug it as it had a large amount of ""alien parts""; I learnt from it, but I think I would have learnt more that period if I focused on building a more simple application; It's also important to mention that I have good experience with building and running a business - I'm disciplined enough to learn fine on my own - but for others its much more meaningful to make it a more social thing and learn collectively as a unit, ie. join a bootcamp"

1721,1555513434.1262,Eliana,ah i see. back when i used Django there was a `manage.py` file in the project directory.

1721,1555513530.1274,Clemmie,that is all correct. I think the current issue is a question of an active virtual environment

1721,1555513674.1301,Clemmie,"the console may start without a venv active. You (might) have 2 options - the first is the activate the venv in the console in the standard cli way for your tooling. The other is there might be a way to trigger the virtual environment when a console starts. The specifics are probably somewhere in VS docs or tutorials; also, some ides have the ability to run a script (say manage.py) but to prompt you for inputs prior to actually running. So you would click, say “run-&gt;manage” and it would open an input box for you to type “loaddata …“. Again, you would have to configure it to do that, if it is available. to the docs again!"

Another option is PyCharm which is a really good Python IDE. You could potentially be working with 2 editors jumping from C#/VB.Net but if it’s solely for Python that might be a good option. A downside is Pycharm is not free.

Any advice on how to get started? The voice recognition feature is the part I care about the most but I'm not sure how to integrate it, or if it's feasible as a web application."

1725,1555529616.1571,Avis,Hey hoping I can be pointed in the right direction (on green side) I have a variable that contains a list and the element within that list have this layout logs-2019.01.10 I would like to be able to read the date section of the element and have the script recognize the date   what is the best approach ?
1725,1555530632.1587,Gemma,"<@Avis>, you can do that with standard library string methods or using the `re` module."
1725,1555530679.1605,Patrica,"<@Avis> I think understand what you’re saying. A simple solution would be to split the string on the hyphen and take the second element of that result.
```
s = 'logs-2019.01.10'
d = s.split('-')[1]
```
A more robust solution would be to use a regular expression"
1725,1555530731.1611,Monika,regular expressions are heavy
1725,1555530759.1621,Avis,yes that's idea but then i would have the time datetime module read the element the make a decision  based on the results
1725,1555530905.1648,Patrica,<@Monika> heavy?

1726,1555531541.1715,Patrica,"<@Granville> Have you looked into `asyncio` and the use of the `yield` keyword? Without knowing more about your specific situation it’s hard to say what the right solution would look like. Potentially, <#C7PFU2B2Q|rxpy> might have some good insights."
1726,1555531670.1733,Granville,"mmm, not yet. I'm stuck on trying to parse a streaming file or essentially either getting the next four lines from a matched line or finding all the lines in the stream file matching a keyword"
1727,1555533076.175,Pasquale,If you are parsing large volumes of data you may want to consider a 3rd party application such as Apache Kafka or IBM Streams Studio and then call your Python from inside the stream parser.  Parsing high volumes of streaming data is difficult to do well.
1727,1555534094.1761,Carmen,"By streaming data/file, do you mean a file containing data from e.g. a video stream a'la Twitch, or are you meaning a realtime appended file, a'la a logfile?; I'm assuming the latter, in which case you honestly need to be using infinite loops to regularly pull data from the end of the file and apply your parsing to that.; And of course, depending on the processing that needs to be done vs the amount of data being added to the file, you might need to apply some parallel processing and task queues to the mix to get your results done in real-time."
1726,1555534723.1793,Gemma,Looks like <@Granville> has some googling to do to narrow down the scope of his question!

1732,1555562495.1975,Mildred,"what are you trying to achieve, and what exactly is the error?"
1732,1555562529.1978,Kam,it prints nothing in second case.; i want to be able to assign those return values in other function.; no errors in second case but no result on stdout.; when i return and don't do print explicitly from within the function.
1732,1555563131.2008,Mildred,"sorry, not ignoring, looking into it.

Not something ive come up against, and not something im incredibly familiar with, but i will try anyway"
1732,1555563205.201,Kam,"It's no problem.; it's something i don't understand, maybe it's an issue with decorator"
1732,1555563511.2021,Mildred,"printing from inside the main is fine.

I would suggest its more about the fact that you are trying to print the main() function."
1732,1555563591.2032,Kam,well i mean even if I do an assignment like `result=main() print(result)`; that doesn't work either.; shouldn't it assign returned values from main function to `result`?
1732,1555563684.2059,Sasha,It looks like there are some code paths where invoking `main()` could lead to an error case where Click just calls `sys.exit()`. So it may be aborting the program instead of just not printing anything. Could you try to disambiguate that case by printing something before and after the `print(main())` call?
1732,1555563736.2062,Kam,$? is 0 though; I can.
1732,1555563771.2072,Sasha,"That's probably not it, then, if you get a good exit code."
1732,1555563797.2081,Mildred,"<@Sasha>
i think its the way its returning the values, even by commiting main() to a variable, theres nothing there; i can print them inside the main, i just cant get them out"
1732,1555563819.2089,Sasha,"(As an aside, Click is weird. I've seen it come up in these channels before and the behavior is always odd in convoluted ways...)"
1732,1555563833.2092,Kam,"ok so  I am trying this; ```if __name__ == '__main__':
     print('test 1')
     l=main()
     print(l)
     print('test 2')```"
1732,1555563872.2097,Mildred,test 2 doesnt print does it
1732,1555563889.2102,Kam,only 'test 1' got printed.; yeah.
1732,1555563903.2108,Mildred,"def main(date, instrument):

1732,1555563923.2115,Kam,"The thing is i could do all my logic in one function, i just wanted to nest the logic to different functions; But since I can't use return values it makes it impossible.; yeah, same here.; I can just use argparse, it's fine. I've spent too much time already.; Don't think it's worth it. But there are numerous people using click library.; It would of been noticed by now.; and if i change the name from main to any other name i get same result as well.; <@Sasha> <@Mildred> i just straced and it seem that @click.command() decorator makes a function as a command; so i see after `test 1` rt_sigaction(SIGINT being called by click; which makes sense since click is trying to make the function into a good command-line citizen, so when it exit the function, it calls sys.exit() with the appropriate exit number; just FYI; Thank you for help."

1734,1555578682.2273,Faustina,nop
1734,1555578704.2278,Cindy,problem is in pages.language supposedly since it's a foreign key. Did select_related not work for you ?
1734,1555578727.2285,Faustina,"tried select_related, on Pages.object; but that didn't helped"
1734,1555578731.2289,Cindy,Pages.objects.select_related('language').all().order_by('created')

1735,1555579137.2311,Russ,"Then I'd put a debugger and log queries to console, then make request and see when exactly it hits db"
1734,1555579412.2319,Faustina,"so looks like I had to move Pages.object out of get_actions() method, put it in list, and then duplicate queries is gone, weird"

c = [    0,    b1,    b2,    b3]
```"
1738,1555593747.2417,Carmen,"This is 90% correct. The final entry isn't just a path to a script, but a full-on shell command to run. We normally have it run a script, but just saying it's a path to a script ignores that you can redirect the outputs as with any other command, which is highly useful.

Also, if the cron entry is an entry in `/etc/crontab`, there are 7 entries. Immediately after the first 5 time entries is a parameter specifying the user to run the final command as. If it's an entry in the user crontab, then the 6-entry description is accurate."

1738,1555594154.2489,Carmen,"If you're using those as placeholders for the lists, not just variables defined elsewhere, then the main issue I'm seeing with that is that you're defining a circular relationship between lists `b` and `c`.

1743,1555604881.2764,Jamey,"`venv` isn't working :cry:; `Error: Command '['/home/board-tutorial/venv/bin/python3.7', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`; The above is output from `python3.7 -m venv venv`"
1743,1555605197.2783,Kam,what does this do `python3.7 -m venv /tmp/my_python37`
1743,1555605230.2788,Jimmy,:point_up: `python -m venv` is the documented way now; but looks like there is a problem in installing pip :thinking_face:
1743,1555605411.2798,Jamey,I installed pip like this `wget <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>` and  `sudo -H python3.7 get-pip.py`.
1743,1555605519.2807,Jimmy,looks wrong; how did you install python ?
1743,1555605549.2814,Jamey,So the system `pip`... I may have upgraded the system `pip`. Maybe that's the problem? Since Ubuntu installs `python-pip` as a package and not in the way I've done
1743,1555605575.2819,Jimmy,I don't know; what I would do is remove the python3.7 you installed and reinstall `python-pip`; then reinstall python3.7 (preferably with pyenv); afaik `pip` should be included in standard python now
1743,1555605708.2841,Jamey,I installed `python3.7` like this: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` &gt; `sudo apt update` &gt; `sudo apt install python3.7`
1743,1555605766.2846,Jimmy,hmm I'm not familiar with that ppa but I don't use ubuntu; you may want to look into pyenv or maybe there is a `python3.7-pip` packages to install ?
1743,1555607380.286,Jamey,<@Jimmy> it's alright. I removed 3.7. It is causing too much conflict.; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯; <@Jimmy> :taco:  for the help
1743,1555607476.287,Chester,<@Jamey> I use <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv> for managing different pythons on my systems; Works perfectly
1743,1555607626.2875,Deangelo,Thanks for checking!
1743,1555608989.2881,Jamey,<@Chester> have seen this around a couple of times. Will try it out. Thanks.
1744,1555609230.2883,Angle,"Hi, does anyone know how to reduce the time taken to upload the file to a server in python?"
1744,1555609464.2886,Clemmie,make the file smaller or the bandwidth larger
1744,1555609750.2888,Claudine,:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
1744,1555609966.2897,Lawrence,<@Angle> I don't think Python will be the bottle neck in that situation if you are transferring a single file via some network protocol
1744,1555610066.2903,Angle,Any suggestions if you have come across similar situation?
1744,1555610171.2907,Karoline,you could potentially compress it
1744,1555610242.2909,Lawrence,<@Karoline>'s suggestion sounds like a good approach
1744,1555610643.2913,Angle,"I wont have it unless its uploaded by the user. I am handling only the backend part; So I wont be able to zip it; How ,btw?"
1744,1555610731.2923,Karoline,then there's not a whole lot you can do aside from potentially deploying endpoints closer to the user
1744,1555610759.2933,Hiroko,"<@Angle> is the problem user-end or your bandwidth; if user-end, not much you can do"
1745,1555610969.2965,Terrilyn,"<@Conchita> -__- I've been conditioned to use this with only 4 lines of code or less (I blame ps1 slack), completely forgot it has a spoiler.. thanks!"
1746,1555613564.2978,Al,Any recommendations for a simple websocket server for Python2?
1746,1555613590.2979,Kam,Is this okay to do this to have function to implement logging and then return logger object to use in main(); None
1747,1555614565.2985,Carmen,"Do you have any control over the frontend, even indirectly through API interface design?"
1746,1555614634.299,Lawrence,<@Al> there is `wsgiref` in the Python 2 standard lib <https://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html>
1746,1555614671.2991,Carmen,"If so, you could use a resumable API setup, and get automatic parallelism via client side libraries implementing that protocol.

<https://pypi.org/project/python-resumable/>"
1746,1555614707.2995,Lawrence,"I don't see anything wrong with this approach. It may depend on the context of what you are ultimately implementing, but this appears to be okay to me :thumbsup:"
1746,1555614782.2997,Carmen,"Alternately, if it makes sense for your architecture, you could take advantage of direct-upload to AWS S3 and let AWS handle all the hard work of optimally receiving uploads. I guarantee they have better bandwidth than you do. And then you just pull the uploaded file from the S3 bucket at your convenience to process."
1746,1555615349.301,Tanja,"It's a graph, vertices and edges so I need to plot the distance that represents the edges between 2 nodes"
1747,1555615848.3012,Kam,Thank you.
1748,1555617691.3018,Al,"<@Lawrence> Thanks, I'll take a look"
1748,1555617807.302,Monika,"We are trying to apply DDD to our project (php) recently, and I really like the concepts behind it. We have a decoupled architecture and a extensive use of dependency injection and i think that is a nice approach for large app. But i don't see many of this concepts in the Python world. So the question is , what do you think about Python, dependency injection and DDD?. Thanks in advanced"
1749,1555618234.3058,Clemmie,"It’s amazing to me that consultants make money selling DDD concepts - it is just good systems design practice. In a way it is the same with Dependency injection, we don’t really talk about it much. Mostly it is because, in statically type languages dependency injection is a Big Difficult Idea :tm: leading to frameworks that abstract away the difficulties. Python is dynamically typed and so it is easy to build up Inversion of Control, to a degree that you might look at some python code and say “You are using dependency injection? I love it” and the response is “What’s dependency injection?”"
1746,1555618590.307,Hiroko,you can use django as a good example of a project using DI
1750,1555618625.3076,Danae,"Hi all, is there any library in python which would help with creating dynamic web page (with graphics/charts) where I could hover over some items and it would display some kind of pop up with additional information ?"
1746,1555618695.3079,Hiroko,sounds like you want a mix of python and javascript; you can’t do all this in python; gonna need some browser side work in javascript
1746,1555619065.3099,Lashawna,<https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started>
1746,1555619330.3113,Angle,U r amazing; Thanks
1746,1555619353.312,Lashawna,"<@Danae> That should do what you need without requiring you to know a lot about html, css, or any Javascript.; <https://dash.plot.ly/gallery>"
1746,1555619855.3127,Monika,<@Hiroko> the django code base?
1746,1555619937.3129,Hiroko,"yeah, especially the ORM"

1752,1555629443.3196,Lawrence,<@Danette> did you receive any errors?
1753,1555629568.321,Danette,"<@Lawrence> Yes, seems like a generic message: 400. Something went wrong. Check your subscription key and headers. My subscription key works for sure bc I'm still able to get an MP3 when I run the code without the lexicon."
1753,1555629744.3218,Lawrence,I'm unfamiliar with lexicon or azure but could it be a bad request? perhaps something with the uri?
1753,1555630183.3225,Carmen,"Right offhand, that second line looks odd. Do you know for sure you need the curly brackets around `<http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace>`?"

1753,1555630911.3257,Lawrence,am I correct in my assumption that `app.py` lives within the directory `couchapp`? `no such file or directory` means it cannot find `app.py` in its current working directory

1754,1555639045.33,Priscilla,"so you have a program that moves through functions proceduraly, Step 1, Step2, Step3, etc... and you want to be able to go back one step. How do you go about that? is it as simple as this? know of a better way? its a command line program btw."
1754,1555639415.3311,Sasha,"You may want to look into ""state machines"", which are a common abstraction for general schemes of this form."
1754,1555639438.3313,Priscilla,"on it, thanks!; oh damn, lots of new words in this explanation :fearful:"
1754,1555639698.3321,Sasha,"Heh heh, yell if you get stuck somewhere."
1755,1555640260.3325,Priscilla,what ide do you use ed?
1755,1555640404.3341,Sasha,"For Python, honestly I just use emacs. For other stuff, usually Eclipse derivatives. I'm probably not a good person to learn IDE habits from, though."

1755,1555640604.3358,Priscilla,"neat, that sounds like a fun project; is python your prefered language?"
1755,1555640746.3375,Sasha,"It's definitely my favorite, and my go-to choice for anything on the small to medium side. Professionally I've often worked in embedded systems, and it's hard to avoid C there, though."
1755,1555640879.3377,Priscilla,have you used rust?
1755,1555640958.3381,Sasha,Afraid not. Worth digging into?
1755,1555641081.3403,Priscilla,"i think it is. I used it a tiny amount but found it very readable just getting started. I was interested in it because of its memory safety aspects which I didnt quite understand with C. I hear that may be why many devs dont like it, not as much control as C but I wouldn't know that lol."
1755,1555641252.342,Sasha,"Hahaha, yeah, ""memory safety"" and ""C"" don't really go together. Thanks for the pointer, sounds interesting."

1759,1555671070.3449,Kalyn,hi beginner question how can I use data from a function in a list as follow <https://p.6core.net/p/cz7SI1OoJmR3kyMV4TOYOdR9>; i want the info from ips or def getIpAddresses in the message
1759,1555671157.3461,Susan,note for beginner: <http://pep8.org|pep8.org> :slightly_smiling_face: snake_case and spaces
1759,1555671243.3464,Kalyn,thats something I need to work on :wink:
1759,1555671264.3467,Susan,"maybe <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html> would be handy; `messages = [ ""announce flow route { match { destination"" "" ips ""  ""/32;  } then { discard;  }  }"" ]` that's just a list of one element"
1759,1555671357.3482,Kalyn,can’t use data from for loop in element?
1759,1555671360.3483,Susan,"and `ips` equals None; `stdout.write(... + '\n'); flush` -&gt; `print(..., flush=True)`; `""destination "" "" ips "" "" /32""` just equals `""destination  ips  /32""`"
1759,1555671526.3504,Kalyn,yeah trying to get that data in there but I guess I have to make a sum of lists elements
1759,1555671531.3507,Susan,"if you need to insert a list in the middle of list
`[""prefix"", *ips, ""suffix""]`; `getIpAddresses` should `return ip_range`"

1761,1555674991.3595,Alvina,"any handy tools I am not aware of for guessing datatypes from a csv file for databases? I used to use pandas often (had issues with ID columns with nulls turning into decimals like 188282889.0), right now I am using something called tableschema (python library); None; typically generating a list of dicts, like that"
1761,1555675151.3632,Nieves,guessing datatypes?; Couldn't you read each line or whatever in the file and compare or something?; Pretty sure Python has the ability to tell the datatype or whatever natively?; One sec...
1761,1555675229.3659,Ashley,"<@Nieves> yeah, selenium is slow because it's dependent on a web browser, and I don't recommend it for scraping (not just because it's dependent on a browser, but because it uses the WebDriver protocol, which can be limiting). Bs4 and requests make a very solid combo, but there's no JS engine involved, so that may limit you in other ways. There's also scrapy which is built for scraping, but I don't believe it uses a JS engine either (I could be wrong though)"
1761,1555675263.3669,Nieves,Yeah... no Selenium. Webdriver protocol needs to die btw. Thinking a mix of PhantomJS and the like...; I could always parse for JS manually
1761,1555675285.3682,Ashley,WebDriver is actually fantastic. It's just not built for scraping ;); PhantomJS is dead though I think
1761,1555675307.3695,Nieves,all the tools I have seen for scraping use selenium and I always shake my head; No
1761,1555675311.3702,Alvina,"<@Ashley> i will need to look at some other options. I have some selenium things running daily since like 2014 (have to log into a website, select some filters and a date picker, export a file when the page loads). I am afraid to even look at that code.."
1761,1555675312.3703,Nieves,PhantomJS is alive and well
1761,1555675317.3706,Ashley,"Yeah, it's not built for scraping"

1761,1555675394.3743,Alvina,you can still push buttons and all of that stuff? I know i am navigating through pages and people have some weird date selection popups which threw me off when I tried bs4 or whatever (this is years ago)
1761,1555675397.3745,Ashley,"Very true; However, it may not be worth it, since chromium is open source and now has a headless mode"

1761,1555675630.3808,Ashley,"<@Alvina> with bs4, you can't really click buttons. It's just an XML parser that was designed with HTML in mind and there's no JS engine involved, but IIRC it knows how to emulate certain behavior should you want to click certain buttons. It's pretty simple to do though if you know how HTML forms work (it boils down to a web request to the server at the designated endpoint with the values from the form in a certain format)"
1761,1555675648.3812,Nieves,buttons are in html; Or forms... which is still html
1761,1555675666.3819,Ashley,"Yeah, but bs4 can't ""click"" them; As in there's no click event"
1761,1555675677.3825,Nieves,not really click them; xD
1761,1555675713.3848,Alvina,selenium was a bit easier to wrap my head around because it was literally the steps I would do manually
1761,1555675714.385,Nieves,"I can't remember exactly how buttons work, but don't they have a link coded into them?"
1761,1555675721.3855,Ashley,"But it can try to look at what sort of requests that would send to the server if it's a standard form and no JS trickery is going on, and it might be able to send a request like it; Not exactly"
1761,1555675732.3861,Alvina,even headless was easy to set up with some intermediate screenshots and trial and error
1761,1555675732.3862,Nieves,JS can be blocked?; I know on FF... you can disable JS; and others
1761,1555675758.3883,Alvina,"yeah, some of our sites are custom company made ones with a ton of javascript and mess"
1761,1555675762.3886,Nieves,Not a web-dev; lol
1761,1555675773.3895,Alvina,"so I am not pulling data from standard nice websites, most of the time"

1761,1555675816.393,Nieves,CS requires a certain wired brain
1761,1555675823.3933,Ashley,"If they're part of a form, they'd usually have a type like `submit`, which would then have the form submit to the server"
1761,1555675830.3937,Nieves,Yeah... that is what I was trying to say
1761,1555675835.3941,Ashley,The form is what has the link and request method knowledge
1761,1555675848.3945,Nieves,"pretty much, you can fill the form out... send a post request and than see what response is returned...; Success is 200"
1761,1555675859.3951,Ashley,Yep
1761,1555675869.3954,Nieves,Yeah... remember messing around with Burp and cURL
1761,1555675953.3962,Ashley,"Also, <@Alvina> that's exactly what selenium/WebDriver is meant for; emulating user interactions"
1761,1555675959.3964,Nieves,Sigh... already issues in Pycharm
1761,1555675991.3973,Ashley,Vs code has a good python plugin. Very customizable
1761,1555676018.3976,Nieves,Don't mention VS to me... just saying...; I run Linux; So yeah...; VSC++ isn't bad though; Once you figure out WinAPI and WinINet
1761,1555676075.3996,Ashley,Vscode runs great on Linux. MS actually just created an official snap package for it
1761,1555676081.3998,Nieves,I know; I just don't like MS that much; They are doing better; Probs should move this conversation to random so the admins don't complain
1761,1555676106.4011,Ashley,They're really kissing ass to the Linux/Dev commuting lately
1761,1555676115.4014,Nieves,Oh they are cuz Linux is the future; They will need to adapt or go bankrupt

1762,1555679103.4041,Nieves,Just took a peek at dogpile and the data it returns via burp... strange... it uses multiple different apis from like bing and such.
1762,1555679468.4059,Claudine,"I've gotta do some vetting for API testing frameworks. My initial thought is to just go with selenium and mock data, anyone have any other suggestions?"
1762,1555679768.4064,Hiroko,<@Claudine> what do you mean by api testing?; Load testing?
1762,1555679795.4075,Nieves,REST JSON?
1762,1555679797.4077,Claudine,oh no like automatic unit testing and stuff
1762,1555679798.408,Hiroko,E2e external tests?
1762,1555679803.4082,Claudine,to make sure it's working
1762,1555679803.4083,Nieves,Why selenium?
1762,1555679821.4088,Claudine,"im familiar with it, it can hit endpoints; coupled with a DB connection we can validate the data it creates on POST/PUTs"
1762,1555679900.4107,Hiroko,So integration tests 
1762,1555679904.411,Claudine,yea
1762,1555679906.4111,Nieves,Is selenium the only lib/module that you understand?; There are prolly other libs that can be imported that do a more efficient job
1762,1555679924.4121,Claudine,"i can pick up anything fairly easy, i believe"
1762,1555679933.4126,Hiroko,"If this is an api, it's returning json or xml, right?"
1762,1555679945.4133,Nieves,Probs a REST JSON API
1762,1555679948.4135,Claudine,"yes, 99% json with 1 endpoint that returns XML"
1762,1555679963.414,Hiroko,Why not just use requests and hit the endpoints and compare with what you expect?
1762,1555679984.4148,Nieves,"Was thinking that as well <@Hiroko>; Like, selenium is fine for certain things; But is bloated a bit; Most likely all you have to do is check the results that is returned so selenium is a bit much?; ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1762,1555680032.417,Claudine,agreed selenium is not as fast as requests for this situation. there is a possibility that this API will be extended far past the current use case in future
1762,1555680042.4176,Hiroko,Selenium is good when you need to interact with a browser without needing a display 
1762,1555680045.4178,Claudine,so i as thinking a selenium based test suite would be extensible in that case
1762,1555680051.4182,Hiroko,And sloooow
1762,1555680055.4184,Claudine,very slow
1762,1555680055.4185,Nieves,Yeah... so selenium is a bad idea for the future if it might get bigger (?); :/; In a business and such... faster is better
1762,1555680081.4202,Hiroko,Why not stick to current api responses?
1762,1555680089.4207,Claudine,"well i might need to do some DOM/browser stuff in the future, suppose i could always use beautifulSoup for that"
1762,1555680124.4217,Hiroko,What's 'future' mean here in your timeline?
1762,1555680143.422,Claudine,maybe a year out but i probably won't still be here; maybe half a year out depending on what Q4 looks like
1762,1555680209.4231,Nieves,Q4?
1762,1555680215.4234,Claudine,Quarter 4
1762,1555680216.4236,Nieves,so QQQQ?; xD
1762,1555680335.4244,Hiroko,"Sounds too far in the future for actual planning and implementation ; Because requirements can and will change from now and then, if it ever comes along "
1762,1555680420.4255,Nieves,"And also, 10+ code that doesn't work anymore is a pain to fix and cleanup"
1763,1555682265.4273,Cordell,That's a long documentation..  but I found it. thanks
1763,1555682477.4293,Ashley,"Just throwing it out there, but Selenium itself and the WebDriver protocol are very fast and lightweight. The bottleneck is the browser (and your connection to the site) which is why Selenium is a great choice for tests that inherently require a browser anyway. Not so great of a choice if you don't need the browser"
1763,1555682996.43,Nieves,Ight <@Ashley> admit it... you fanboy Selenium... &lt;//3
1763,1555683332.431,Ashley,"Nah, I just understand how it works and where it should/can be used (and where it shouldn't)"

1764,1555684157.4323,Claudine,"I decided to go `requests` initially with a note that selenium could be useful in the future; we're probably 40% through this project, in a perfect world we would have built tests concurrently, or done some TDD"

1771,1555697578.4523,Sasha,"That's totally fine and standard. If a variable exists where the function is being called from, you can pass it to the function."

1771,1555698300.4539,Sasha,"Are you running into any problems with this? It looks pretty normal.; Though your `for` loop looks problematic, since you're reassigning `values1` while iterating over it."

1771,1555698511.4551,Avis,I guess is this the conventional way of creating a function and passing the variables to another function ?; yea i noticed when i remove the print statement it gives me an error in the for loop
1771,1555698747.4556,Sasha,"It's slightly non-conventional in that you're wrapping up the return values and passing them as a unit. It works, but it can be hard to understand what's going on. Often people would do:
```def checker(values, past):
  ... stuff ...

def main():
  values, past = check_indices()
  checker(values, past)```
That just makes it more obvious to the reader what kind of data is being generated and passed in."
1771,1555699035.4559,Avis,can you suggest any good books or literature  that would fill in the gaps.  what's a little confusing is the fact that arguments we are giving the functions checker is the same as the parameter.
1771,1555699293.4561,Sasha,"You mean using the same name? Yeah, that needs a little twist of your mindset... `def checker(values, past)` is basically saying, ""Whatever thing is passed to this function in the first parameter, I'm going to label it `values` inside my function code, no matter what it was called before. And the second thing is now labeled `past`, even if the outside variable was named `hot_dogs`.""; Variable names are intended to help humans reading the code, but to the compiler, their meaning has very strict restrictions, so you want to remember that they're fundamentally arbitrary."
1771,1555699598.4565,Avis,ahh:thinking_face: so what's more important is the arguments we are passing the function.rather  than the parameter name ?; its making sense :pray: ah man Thanks !
1771,1555700248.4569,Sasha,"No problem. Actually, Python can pass arguments both by position and by name. The latter is mostly used if you have a large number of optional arguments. So you might see `foo(one, two, special=True)`, where `one` and `two` are just the generic first and second arguments, but `special` is a named argument."
1771,1555701590.4571,Avis,I'll keep that one in mind ....yeah there was some examples on the net some  people using *args and * kwargs as parameters as well
1771,1555701765.4575,Sasha,"Yep, that's useful when you want to have a function take a variable number of arguments and be able to process them like a list or a dict. It doesn't come up a lot, but it can be handy in certain cases."

1773,1555706504.4616,Sasha,I think <@Priscilla> meant that he gets into the habit of including `self` even in non-method functions.

1773,1555709867.4633,Priscilla,"how come this function gives me an attribute error after returning the correct output?

I am calling it with `print(ser_menu().output)`; everything online says this happens when a function returns `None` but that isnt the case since it returns a string right?"
1773,1555710428.4673,Sasha,"The print statement is implying that the function returns an object with an ""output"" attribute. A regular return value is just unnamed, so you'd want to print just the value ""ser_menu()"".; Or in other words, a return statement returns the value of a thing, irrespective of the variable name inside the function... ""return output"", ""return foo"", or ""return 114"" are all okay and the caller can't tell the difference."
1773,1555710788.4712,Priscilla,"oh neat it worked, but how come it adds and extra `None` now when i run it?

`Service menu test -&gt; PASS
None`"
1773,1555710878.4731,Sasha,"The return value of a print statement is None. So you print correctly inside the function, but return an output value of None to be printed by the outer print statement."
1773,1555710953.4733,Priscilla,:confused:
1773,1555710986.4742,Sasha,Do you want to return a string instead of printing it inside the function?

first_good = string[:beginning]
second_good = string[beginning+len(opening_tag):end]
third_good = string[end+len(closing_tag):]
sum = first_good + second_good + third_good```; `find` finds the index of the place the substring begins; and you get the end index using `len(string)`"

1783,1555800240.0161,Sasha,"Yep, a loop would be perfectly fine. You can also potentially use a quick list comprehension with tuples:
```amount, name = max((x[1], x[0]) for x in patients)```"
1783,1555800585.0163,Milly,"Ah! Thanks, <@Sasha>! Should I be changing my list to a tuple to do that?"
1783,1555800638.0165,Sasha,"No, that's not necessary... anything you can iterate over will work the same way.; However, you may consider changing to a dict, with the name as the key and the cost as the value. That way you wouldn't need to scan through it to look someone up, etc.; Depends how you want to use the data."

""treatment"": insulin,}
for x in patient1:
	print(patient1)
	break"
1783,1555800890.0175,Sasha,"Gotcha. For something like that, you might also consider having a patient class, with name, treatment, etc. as attributes.; Dicts tend to be better when the keys are ""data"" as well, like mapping states names to state capitals. If the keys are few and standardized, a class can make better sense. But either way can work."
1783,1555800960.0179,Milly,Oh I haven't learned about classes yet. okay! and that way I could find which out of all my patients received the most expensive treatments?
1783,1555801020.0181,Sasha,"Almost any data structure will let you find the maximum cost with some sort of a loop, so that'll be relatively easy no matter how you organize things."
1783,1555801148.0183,Milly,"so for what you provided me before, nothing comes up. so would i put print(max(patients) afterward? because I'm only given the first name and cost as a result and thats not the most expensive.; Sorry for all the messages. I've been having the same issue for like two days. :woman-facepalming:"
1783,1555801192.0187,Sasha,"Sorry, just do `print(name, amount)` to display the result.; The answer is just assigned to those variables."

1783,1555801258.0196,Sasha,"Yep, just use `min()` instead."
1783,1555801310.0198,Milly,Oh the question was second highest. So how would I find that?; You're seriously the best! I really appreciate this!
1783,1555801410.0202,Sasha,"It's not quite the most efficient, but the easiest way is to sort the list, and then you can pick off whatever rank you want. Do you actually want me to show you the answer, or is this a problem you're supposed to solve by yourself, and you just want a hint?"
1783,1555801599.0204,Milly,"No, just you explaining the thought process is helping. I've done the foundation already. But yes, I know about the pop method so I'll try that.; I've only learned to programme 4 days ago so I'm still trying to understand how to think ""like a programmer""."
1783,1555801707.0208,Sasha,"Sure thing, and feel free to ask if you get stuck. You shouldn't really need the `pop()` method, since if you have a sorted list, you can directly access each element by `[0]`, `[1]`, etc.; 4 days? That's awesome! But yeah, it does take some time to gain a problem-solving intuition, especially if you don't know what all the possibilities are yet."
1783,1555801870.0212,Milly,"Yes, the ""possibilities""! That's exactly it.; &amp; Thank you again! I'll keep cranking away at this code. You said ""feel free to ask"" so I'll be back if I get into any more trouble lol. :grinning:"
1783,1555802070.0216,Sasha,"Absolutely. And if I'm not around, the folks in <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> and <#C07EFMZ1N|help> are great resources too."
1784,1555806253.0234,Priscilla,"I dont know how to tackle this problem. I need to take a serial number from the user, then run a number of functions and have the values from those functions append to the corresponding serial number. Does anyone have any suggestions?; it must be soooo common"
1784,1555806436.0248,Sasha,"Can you expand on ""append""? Do you literally mean append to a string, or is it more like the values need to be associated with the serial number in a database?"
1784,1555806649.0255,Priscilla,"litterally append, its all going into a csv and the serial number and all asociated test values will be on the same row"
1784,1555806826.0283,Sasha,"This sounds simple, but there are probably some subtleties. Maybe this:
```serial = input(""Please enter your serial: "")
result = serial + func1(serial)
result += func2(serial)
result += func3(serial)```
If you have many functions, you can loop over them with a `join()` on the results, too.; Or you could do string formatting: `result = ""{}-{}-{}"".format(serial, func1(serial), func2(serial))`."
1784,1555807064.0306,Priscilla,"hmmm... the latter was my first idea, but it wasnt working, hangon i got an idea; ERROR `can only concatenate str (not ""module"") to str`; expected output needs to be `serial, PASS/FAIL` as you can see on line 5 I convert it to a string but the error seems to think its not a string"
1784,1555808139.0349,Sasha,"Okay, there's a decent amount wrong with this, but which line is throwing the error, to start with?; It sounds like there's some confusion between the `import serial` module and your `serial` variable?"
1784,1555808191.0359,Priscilla,oh my god i think so...; line 18 and 20
1784,1555808276.0367,Sasha,How are you calling `keypad_sim_display()`?
1784,1555808438.0372,Priscilla,in my main function I have a all the functions running in the order necessary so its like this; im not going to like what comes next... i can feel it... in mah bones
1784,1555808708.0383,Sasha,When you use `serial` there in the function call... where exactly is it coming from?
1784,1555808743.0388,Priscilla,its returned from the `ser_num()` at line 3
1784,1555808804.0401,Sasha,"If it were returned, you would have `serial = ser_num()`, right?"
1784,1555808837.0408,Priscilla,"so the first thing the user doses is assign a serial number to a device, then the functions lines 6-9 run. if all of those pass according to `keypad_sim_display()` then it will append the word PASS to the serial number; what do you mean?; sorry i dont understand your question; here it is without the conflict of `serial`"
1784,1555809030.0432,Sasha,"When a function returns a value, if you need to do anything with it, you need to capture it to a variable, like `result = foo()`. Otherwise it is just discarded."
1784,1555809103.0443,Priscilla,isnt that saving it in a variable on line 4? i thought it was; or do you mean outside of the function?
1784,1555809195.0451,Sasha,"Outside of the function. ""What happens in a function, stays in the function"", for the most part."
1784,1555809205.0453,Priscilla,"oh! i see; omg omg omg; im so excited!!  thanks <@Sasha> again! spent hours on that, i learned a LOT whooop whoooooP!; :tada:; who pays for this slack room? do we know who is the owner?"
1784,1555810074.0478,Sasha,"AFAIK it's just using the free Slack tier, which is why there's no extended history available."
1784,1555810095.048,Priscilla,oh
1784,1555810120.0486,Karoline,there are a couple ancillary services related to the bot and the site and such that are paid for but yeah the slack itself is the free tier
1784,1555810172.049,Priscilla,wubalubadubdub!!; wouldnt appending a csv be putting a new row and not adding to a row?
1785,1555814854.0501,Clayton,Anybody use 'SpaCy'  ?
1784,1555816310.0513,Priscilla,"as a programmer, what information comment my work with? name? date? name of program? is there a standard way to do it? or should I leave any identifying information out of it?"
1786,1555816546.0534,Sasha,"It varies a lot. Name and date at least is a good way to be able to assert copyright if that's ever needed. Personally I try to also include a program name and just a quick ""what the heck is this thing for"" description to at least jog my memory years from now."
1784,1555816704.0539,Priscilla,should i put my name or my LLC name?; eh i put both; when is a function name too long?
1784,1555817915.0553,Conchita,Whenever :point_up::skin-tone-2: question pops into your mind
1786,1555818040.057,Sasha,"It sort of varies with use. Commonly-used functions ought to be short, like `read()`. If it's specialized and only gets called from one place in one library, go ahead and call it `ReadBudgetSpreadsheetIntoDatabase()`.; But turn off tab completion for a while before you decide long names are fun.  :wink:"
1784,1555818660.0584,Priscilla,good point <@Conchita>
1787,1555820105.059,Conchita,"Why the use of `_` like `_signer`?``` self._service_account_email = service_account_email
        self._signer = signer
        self._scopes = _helpers.scopes_to_string(scopes)
        self._private_key_id = private_key_id
        self.client_id = client_id
        self._user_agent = user_agent
        self._kwargs = kwargs

    def _to_json(self, strip, to_serialize=None):```"
1786,1555820172.0599,Conchita,Have a feeling <@Sasha>  have the answer
1786,1555820212.0605,Sasha,"It's a convention for a class-private variable. It's not enforced like some other languages, but it lets other coders know that they're not ""supposed"" to mess with those attributes, at least.; Whereas `client_id` doesn't have that, so it implies that the author of the class allows you to access `foo.client_id` as a public API for the object."
1786,1555820369.062,Conchita,"So there are both public and private classes, didn't know that!; And variables"
1786,1555820419.0634,Sasha,"There aren't, from a Python language perspective, but it's a common concept in, say, Java, which can be useful to borrow."
1786,1555820450.0639,Conchita,Do you have any example for when its useful with a private class?; Just to get a high-level idea of the use cases; OS and hardware related stuff?
1786,1555820646.0676,Sasha,"Sure. For instance, say you're writing a class which connects to, say, a USB device. You need to maintain a connection to it, and keep track of particular command sequences. It would be a real problem if some other code came in and just randomly borrowed your connection to send other commands or flip some bits in your state. You want your code to be able to rely on the fact that only you can access and change those things, while providing other users with some friendly functions to call instead.; Again, none of this is actually enforced in Python. It's just a way for people to know that they're ""breaking the rules"" if they start poking at the inner logic of a class.; And sometimes you actually want to break the rules, if you're writing a unit test which wants to examine some of that behavior."
1786,1555820906.0702,Conchita,Thanks for the explanation! So its basically a `Don't push this big fat red button` haha
1786,1555820914.0705,Sasha,Exactly!
1786,1555820917.0706,Conchita,"""Stuff might happen""; Enjoy the :taco:  <@Sasha>"
1786,1555821019.0725,Sasha,"It can also save you a lot of time in reading other people's code, as you can tell that big long functions starting with an underscore are ""behind the scenes"" and not something that you might need to call to use the library."
1786,1555821080.0735,Conchita,"Is this what is grouped as ""low-level""? And maybe part of the reason why its not enforced in Python, as Python is a high-level language?"
1786,1555821194.0753,Sasha,"Not really... low- versus high-level usually refers to how close to the patterns of the underlying hardware you are, like whether you have to worry about CPU registers and memory addresses, or only deal in more abstract things like ""dicts""."
1786,1555821226.0756,Conchita,"Ok, got it; Another question, do you have a process for reading other people's code? It feels like I spend way to much time to understand code I have NOT written myself (to a level of understanding where I will modify their code)"
1786,1555821734.0808,Sasha,"I tend to work from the ""outside"" moving in. Start with any documentation and public APIs, then a quick scan through the files to just see what is where. Sometimes the unit tests, if there are any, can provide some nice examples of how the functions are called in practice. Then I make sure I understand any key data structures. And lastly just read line by line, hopefully only targeting a section of the code which I know I'm interested in, although sometimes I have to do a code-review of everything.; But it is a learned skill by itself, and reading bad code can be a challenge for anyone. I've been a bit fortunate to mostly work with great coders, so reading their stuff can be a breeze."
1786,1555822072.084,Conchita,"That sounds like a nice approach - I started line by line, and later discovered the code was let's call it ""un-impressive"", as it was not functioning as the author claimed + no single line of comment / documentation"
1786,1555822120.0844,Sasha,Ugh
1786,1555822144.085,Conchita,I'm gonna apply your approach next time!
1786,1555823116.0857,Priscilla,<@Sasha> do you have any degrees?; if you dont mind me asking...
1786,1555823241.0871,Sasha,"Technically just a bachelors in physics and math, though I went pretty far into a Ph.D. program before dropping out."
1786,1555823268.0874,Priscilla,are you glad you got that bachelors?; i mean like is it relevant to programming and useful in this field?; assuming this isnt just your hobby but also your hjob
1786,1555823576.0912,Sasha,"Yes, I think so... IMHO any sort of technical degree is generally useful for developing the sort of rational problem-solving skills that programming relies on. So it's not specifically useful, but it's generally useful. That said, I started programming from a very young age too, so I probably would have ended up doing some level of coding regardless."
1786,1555823642.0916,Priscilla,interesting how old are you?
1786,1555823666.0918,Sasha,Now? 40's.
1786,1555823683.0921,Priscilla,when did you get in tpo programming?
1786,1555823763.0932,Sasha,"Back in the 80's, the early days of home computers like the Commodore 64."
1786,1555823815.0942,Priscilla,haha cool! i work under an engineer at work who used those in college it would be cool to have
1786,1555823905.0952,Sasha,"Really was a great machine. And it booted up to a BASIC prompt, so the invitation to do some coding was unavoidable.; ```10 PRINT ""HELLO""
20 GOTO 10```"
1786,1555824064.0959,Priscilla,neat!; i am looking at learning basic here soon!
1786,1555824157.0971,Sasha,"It's probably not really worth it these days, except as just an exercise."
1786,1555824233.0984,Priscilla,"thats why i want to learn it, understand a lower language and the people i talk to its the most relevant languge to them for some reason lol; every analogy to me (the programmer in the company) is explained in basic lol"
1786,1555824302.0993,Sasha,Amusing...
1786,1555824360.1002,Priscilla,only because they are electrical or mechanical or optical engineers and have only dablled i guess
1786,1555824679.1019,Sasha,"The limitations of the language sound crazy today. All variables are global, and can only be named a max of two letters, and only be numbers or strings. No such thing as a function, but you can GOSUB to a line number and then RETURN to where you came from."
1788,1555847620.1039,Nieves,"Basic is dead; And for good reason; It had flaws that made it die out; Although, still fun to read about"

On new post i should check if its the same session?; since i dont have any authentication i should just save the session id in the db with the data and once it expires either a new entry is created or some error thrown...

1791,1555859317.1197,Nieves,Yeah... you need to retrieve the access token before you can send the request; Pretty sure; No idea... never used that before; The token would need to also be passed probs as a parameter in the request; And than get results

I’m looking to assign a value to each asset based on decisions on each of these data points. As an example, each asset being a house, and data points including number of windows, garage door, broken fence, etc., each house would have a score. Is there a recommended way of coding this besides a bunch of if statements and adding/subtracting from a score?"
1794,1555908408.1344,Rebeca,"<@Sophia> Your question is quite vague. But here is a way. Assign “costs” to each data point`a_i`  on your asset. Assign a weight `w_i` to each `a_i`. Then for all `n` data points in your asset, your score is the dot product:
```
S = a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... an*xn

1795,1555914189.1356,Conchita,How do you know when to refactor and split logic in one function into 2 or more?
1793,1555914245.1366,Conchita,Reason I ask is I'm writing unit tests now and it feels like it would make sense to move a piece of logic into a separate function
1793,1555914411.1376,Sasha,"That's a good reason. If you ever find yourself using ""and"" in the function name, that's another sign, heh heh.; Some people go by the ""if it's longer than easily fits on my screen"" rule."
1795,1555914940.1385,Conchita,`if it's longer than easily fits on my screen` nowhere near that haha
1793,1555914965.1389,Conchita,I'm just trying to make it easily readable and testable
1793,1555915241.14,Sasha,"Go for it. A too-long function is sufficient, but certainly not necessary."
1795,1555916281.1405,Valeri,<@Conchita> I follow SRP strictly for everything; Every block of code should try and do just one thing and do it well
1793,1555916764.1435,Chester,"<@Conchita> I have two reasons:
1. a part of the logic is required to be re-used by another function (I like to copy-paste things that look familiar before refactoring the duplication)
2. it contains more than 15-20 lines of code (this is a very vague limit, for performance critical things it can be extended without a doubt); For example, I have this function <https://github.com/malinoff/amqproto/blob/master/amqproto/serialization.py#L99-L156> that spans over more than 50 lines, but this is a requirement because this function needs to perform fast; If you look at other functions/methods in amqproto, you'll mostly see bodies with less than 10 lines; usually 3-4"
1795,1555917573.1463,Conchita,"Thanks for the example, will take a closer look at it later. For now I noticed something else in your code - in the bottom you have this ```# Avoid circular imports problem.
from .methods import Method  # noqa
from .content import Content  # noqa
```
Why the . in `.methods`?"
1793,1555917618.1467,Chester,These are relative imports
1793,1555917623.1469,Conchita,And why do you have import statements in the bottom of the file?
1793,1555917683.1481,Chester,"The comment says it :slightly_smiling_face: I use functions from `serialization` module in `methods` and `content` modules, but for convenience I also use `Method` and `Content` methods in `serialization`"
1793,1555917751.1486,Conchita,I read the comment but my current Python lvl isn't high enough to know it lol

1796,1555921595.1512,Nena,"okay, when i create a variable and save this dict, it creates a hash for each key which is totally random and implements a reference to the key and fetched value accordingly. this changes the order of the dict. need to preserve the order"

What do people do in practice?"
1797,1555931142.162,Conchita,"Nice, taking notes"
1798,1555931380.1625,Hiroko,<@Oretha> do you have the python vscode package installed?

1798,1555932653.1699,Oretha,"Yep, I’ve got myself set up and can step into a certain amount of stuff but it is fairy limited. Understandably some stuff only at runtime, but I am curious to know best practice. Eg if I have a dictionary keys() in python3 that gives a View. Id like to explore what I can do with it without resorting to the web. For productivity reasons I am guessing people use a repl in parallel or other ways of exploring code - after all the code is the documentation. So am curious how people work in practice (and some IDE eg Spyder may offer more out the box in this regard). "
1798,1555932782.171,Karoline,Is your concern about needing to go to the web becauase of access issues (like on a train or somewhere without internet) or just because you prefer not to break your flow and say in the editor?
1798,1555933543.1755,Oretha,"The second. I prefer going to the web if I need something in depth, but don’t want to do that to understand how a module or class are put together. I want to avoid breaking flow and feel more productive if I can do all in one place. Eg for the above understanding views by looking at code, autocomplete options, unit test code etc. "
1798,1555933632.1765,Karoline,"makes sense.  for me - it's a combination of the method completion, exploration via the REPL, and yeah the web and/or Dash (and offline docs tool); is the standard method completion not working for you?"
1798,1555933779.1796,Oretha,"It does some of the time, but eg at runtime I don’t have additional options I know how to use ( eg i have a deep stack, an object, and want to understand that object in more detail)"
1798,1555933847.1812,Karoline,so it's more a question then of the runtime interaction of the code and the objects used?

1799,1555937262.194,Alvina,is it possible to use a Docker container (Linux) on windows and the win32com library? I need to download some mail from outlook
1799,1555937332.1947,Karoline,there are some .NET things you can get running under Linux; is it a requirement that the container be linux?  there are windows containers as well.
1799,1555937462.1955,Alvina,"hm, I have a lot of linux containers running; I have not messed with a windows container at all"
1799,1555937586.1974,Karoline,"I've never personally used them, but it's potentially an option - although it's my understanding you can't mix the two (Linux and Windows) containers on the same machine, and the Windows containers only work on Windows as you'd expect.; you might have more luck asking in <#C297RQP0X|os_linux> or <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> though - for now though I'd just ignore the docker aspect of it.  the key question is whether you can use win32com on linux."

1801,1555946261.2113,Clemmie,It means you are passing arguments that a constructor doesn’t use. But in your case that is a red herring - the `pass` is mixing things up; get rid of it

1810,1555993425.2871,Sasha,"You might try printing the `getMessage()` value... I'm slightly suspicious that it may have more stuff in it before the ""Processed"" string."

1810,1555993670.289,Sasha,"Are the ""Processed"" lines being generated by logging calls, or just being printed to stdout?"
1807,1555993921.2906,Kam,"they are generated by stdout  of subprocess.Popen which i log then with `convert_out, convert_err = convert_cmd.communicate()` and `<http://my_logger.info|my_logger.info>(convert_out)` lines"
1810,1555994171.2911,Sasha,Cool. Can you verify that your filter is being called?
1807,1555994213.2914,Kam,yeah i can try to print
1810,1555994285.2922,Kam,so instead of `pass` just do `print(getMessage())` inside of class?
1810,1555994317.2927,Sasha,"Or raise an exception, or whatever. I'm just worried that it's not correctly attached to the handler somehow."
1810,1555994409.293,Kam,"yeah, one sec; so this command as a subporcess argument should replicate `'echo -e Processed 107367496 Packets\nJust a test'`; since original command takes 30 mins to finish"
1810,1555994850.2954,Sasha,"Does the original command output a gazillion ""Processed"" lines that are logged all in one block? If so, the beginning of the first line might have some other stuff."
1810,1555994942.2957,Kam,"yeah, i think that's the case; since once the command finishes; when i tail the log it spills all stdout at once.; with gazillion of those messages; but they all seem to start on the new line; here how it goes"
1810,1555995072.2981,Sasha,"Well, note that the filter is probably going to be called once per log unit, not once per line. So all the output in your `convert_out` will be the message."

1810,1555995155.2992,Sasha,So maybe what you want your filter to do is actually iterate through the lines and modify the message.
1810,1555995156.2993,Kam,so I can do re.match i guess; so i can do `for line in getMessage(): do blah` in my class I guess.
1810,1555995308.301,Sasha,"Yeah, that will actually loop by character, but you can use `split('\n')`, etc."
1810,1555995476.3014,Kam,"okay so i've added this code; ```class my_bin_convert_filter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        if record.getMessage().startswith('Processed'):
            print('hello world')

hello world```; but in the log i don't see another message; from another line `Just a test`"
1810,1555995640.3037,Sasha,"Remember, the `getMessage()` result is both lines, since they were output in one big string by the subprocess call."
1810,1555995688.3041,Kam,so it matches both lines as one message
1810,1555995717.3046,Sasha,"Yes, the message would be `""Processed 107367496 Packets\nJust a test""`."
1810,1555995742.305,Kam,"so if i do `for line in getMessage().split('\n')`:; something like this:; ```class my_bin_convert_filter(logging.Filter):

1810,1555995892.3066,Sasha,"It looks like filters are allowed to modify the `msg` attribute of a record if they want. Note that they just return `True` or `False`, though, not the data."

1830,1556082230.4407,Chester,"You need to have `setup.py`/`setup.cfg` and do `pip install -e .` beforehand.
These are basically the proper way to append to `sys.path`"
1830,1556082246.441,Conchita,Aha; Never touched setup.py before. Will take a look at that
1830,1556082271.4419,Chester,"Although it's not very common to have multiple top-level packages, why do you have them?; If you move all your code in a single package, your relative imports will work"
1830,1556082304.4433,Sasha,You may be missing an `__init__.py` file?
1830,1556082341.4441,Conchita,"Maybe I'll do that instead. Just wanted to seperate different scripts based on their utility; Never user either of `__init__.py` or `setup.py`; Do you recommend I:
a) place all code into a single package
b) Setup `setup.py`
c) Setup `__init__.py`; I'm ms confused right now lol"
1830,1556082461.4466,Sasha,Never mind about `__init__.py`... that seems to be optional in Py3 now.
1830,1556082481.447,Chester,"No, it's not"
1830,1556082503.4478,Conchita,I think option a) would be easiest and wont have any negative implications?
1830,1556082520.4483,Chester,"`__init__.py` is still mandatory. When this file is missing, python3 will still work, but it will do a slightly different thing; rather than a regular import; <@Conchita> if you want to have a package, `__init__.py` is mandatory. You can't go without creating it, really; I think reading <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html> is a must for every python developer at some point; Especially the part about using `setup.cfg` <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files>"
1830,1556082618.4504,Conchita,Ok will do thanks :taco: <@Chester>

Of course, you can always implement your own distributed locking mechanism."

1830,1556087507.456,Chester,"Idempotent means that multiple invocations of the same execution request result in only one and only outcome.; E.g. an idempotent task that updates a value in a database may check first if the value is already updated, and do nothing"

1834,1556108799.4679,Jettie,it's a good exercise probably
1834,1556108810.4682,Christina,i mean you can do a recursive function
1834,1556108826.4683,Jimmy,even better this should use f-string
1834,1556108865.4691,Christina,yeah. but isn't there some issues with join inside a string-interpolated string?
1834,1556108910.4699,Mica,"nah it should be good, just don't use the same type of quotes for join as you do for the full string"
1834,1556108914.4701,Christina,"i was wrong; `f""{','.join(l[:-1])} and {l[-1]}""`
works"
1834,1556108939.471,Mica,"ye if you do `"",""` it'll break"
1834,1556108965.4713,Christina,yep

1834,1556109057.4731,Jimmy,I don't think pep8 says anything regarding that. I now use black for new projects and it does that. I like it
1834,1556109299.4739,Christina,PEP8 was also written before interpolation was proposed :stuck_out_tongue: but pep-0498 doesn't seem to include anything regarding style guidelines

What do you mean by listed in?"
1838,1556119425.4986,Jeannine,"these are the categories we can make products in on amazon; if a category has child categories, it cannot be listed into; you have to get the the end of the 'tree' before you can choose the category"
1838,1556119464.0003,Christina,"so if you want to check whether to make a list simply do:
```if 'accessories' in foo['bass guitars']:

else:
  foo['bass guitars'] = [value]```"
1838,1556119510.0019,Jeannine,"<@Christina> correct, except the next line in the csv file may state that there are child categories and so this needs to be a list, not the final data"

1838,1556119574.0042,Christina,"oh so the lowest level is a dict, but all the others are lists?. why would you have that? in your example, the list only has one entry, a dict with the key being the child"

I'd say you need to have a quickstart section for the most common use-case, and then a section where you descibe advanced usage with lots of examples. Everything else depends of what the product is"
1879,1556376307.2003,Carmen,"Yes, that's what I meant.; Typically, when people are putting in an options object to hold configuration values, they'll name it `opt`. That's a regular and understandable abbreviation variable name.; So without any other information than the line of code in question, we're assigning a local variable to the value of a member (with the exact same name) of an object that happens to conform to a standard options object naming convention. It seems reasonable that `opt` is supposed to be an options object, and there's just some code copying that occurred from someone who wasn't paying attention."

1884,1556405151.2313,Carmen,"It's possible that the API user doesn't have permissions on the bucket, even though you copied over permissions from the bucket. Can you verify that the user is part of a permissions group or straight up has direct permissions to the new bucket?"

1883,1556405198.2325,Frankie,I've verified the latter - it works locally; this is once it tries to run the command from the EC2 instance; on deploy
1883,1556405262.2342,Carmen,Does your EC2 instance have the API permissions in the environment when it's executing the transfer?; *API credentials
1883,1556405284.2348,Frankie,"well it has the AWS access key and secret key in the environment variables if that's what you mean; and FWIW, it can put static files in the elastic beanstalk bucket whenthe container commands run collectstatic just before this, so I know that the user running manage.py collectstatic has access to the EB bucket...which is why I tried a derivation of those permissions on the new bucket I created; also, there's no CORS config or ACL on that bucket...it's just a bucket policy"
1883,1556405981.2373,Bethany,use an IAM role on the ec2 instance; with permissions to upload to the s3 bucket
1883,1556405997.2381,Carmen,Maybe try temporarily switching the collectstatic command to point at your new bucket and see if it can upload.
1883,1556406214.2394,Frankie,"<@Carmen> that would risk a bunch of other annoying potential problems so I don't want to do that. <@Bethany> I was trying to use the same role that was created along w/ all the other elastic beanstalk magic, but I might be using it wrong or not using it at all; though I think I might have found a potential reason it's not working."

1883,1556407843.2567,Frankie,I think I'm gonna try smashing my face into the keyboard and see if that helps.
1883,1556407849.2569,Bethany,it might
1883,1556407899.2575,Frankie,it's annoying cause I know it works cause I can run the command locally here on my machine and push a file up to it w/ no problem even w/o a bucket policy or anything; so it's def some hidden AWS crap causing the problem.
1883,1556407933.2583,Bethany,can you inspect the instance after its provisioned to see it's access policies
1883,1556407950.2586,Frankie,"hmmm I hadn't tried that but yeah I'll look at the instance itself.; maybe it's using something I haven't seen in the roles; as a side note, any idea how I can at least run the command on the EC2 instance itself from the command line soI don't have to keep redeploying?; it seems just running `python manage.py export_user_data` after activating the env and stuff can't create the file on the EC2 instance; it creates the file when using the container command but I can't do it manually and when I use sudo it gives me a syntax error. lol"

1883,1556408238.2625,Frankie,that's the top part; permission denied lol
1883,1556408243.2629,Bethany,this might be a django thing and I'll be no help there; is the csv a local file?
1883,1556408276.2635,Frankie,"the export command is supposed to create it locally, yes; basically I want to create the CSV on the EC2 instance, push it to S3, then delete it from EC2; every time I deploy; it works to create it on deployment, but won't push to S3...but when I just try to run the command on the EC2 instance, it won't create the damn file and if I sudo it gives me a syntax error. I'm bout to lose it. lol; so at best all I can do right now is redeploy repeatedly to test it, which is annoying cause it takes like 4 minutes to redeploy just to see it fail so it's taking forever to debug it"
1883,1556408416.2665,Bethany,"so you provision the thing, then push some data from it to s3? But where does the data come from originally?"
1883,1556408430.2668,Frankie,the database connected to the thing :slightly_smiling_face:
1883,1556408452.2673,Bethany,ok so its db -&gt; django on ec2 -&gt; s3?
1883,1556408462.2675,Frankie,yes; I guess really it's more like push code to ec2 -&gt; query RDS (database) -&gt; generate csv on ec2 -&gt; push csv to S3 -&gt; delete csv from EC2
1883,1556408531.2689,Bethany,"the ec2 stays around afterwards, right?"
1883,1556408610.2703,Priscilla,I cant seem to figure out how to populate a dictionary with a user-determined number of keys. nothing i try works :facepalm:
1883,1556408636.2709,Frankie,"actually, the EC2 instance will not stick around afterwards; once the code is deployed successfully it will be replaced by the load balancer; that's why I don't just want to store the csv on EC2...its ephemeral"
1883,1556408680.2721,Bethany,<@Priscilla> what did you try to do?; ok I'm a bit confused. Once deployed the ec2 gets undeployed or does it get put behin ELB with other instances?
1883,1556409015.2739,Priscilla,hangon... trying one more thing that just came to mind
1883,1556409105.2749,Hiroko,"<@Frankie> the issue seems to be the file doesn't have the necessary system permissions for the management command to access ; That's what the stack trace is telling you with the permission denied bit ; So what perms are attached to the file, and what user:group?"
1883,1556409390.2793,Frankie,"<@Bethany> so basically what happens is that when I deploy from my local machine, it uploads a zip file to S3...there is an SQS queue listening for that upload (all this is configured by elastic beanstalk btw), when the SQS queue sees the upload, it first (I think) clones the existing instance to maintain uptime, disconnects the EC2 instance from the load balancer, deploys the new app version, and then reattaches it. when it reattaches it after a successful deployment it will have a new IP. then it terminates the cloned instance; assuming you just have a single instance system. How the load balancer is configured determines how many it'll allow to be running at once, but I just have it allow only two (one for prod and one for staging)"
1883,1556409475.2803,Priscilla,"nope, nothing I try works and this is the only thing I think is close. I tried googling, but found nothing relevant. I am shooting blind here, I don't really know how to implement what i want to do :angry:"
1883,1556409534.2813,Frankie,<@Hiroko> looks like the perms on the directory I'm trying to create the file in are 755
1883,1556409551.282,Hiroko,"<@Priscilla> you're returning something from the number function but not using it anywhere ; Eg, no variable in main to store the return value "
1883,1556409611.283,Bethany,<@Priscilla> do you want to keep prompting for input and put the result in a dictionary?
1887,1556409662.2839,Priscilla,yes
1883,1556409717.2849,Bethany,"what is the key and what is the value. do you want `my_dict = {""user_first_input"": ????}` or `my_dict = {??????? : ""user_first_input""}` and what do you want the  ????? to be"
1883,1556409796.2856,Priscilla,"i would like the user input to the key, because the key is a serial number, and the values will be a list."
1883,1556409809.2861,Bethany,and you're storing that list somewhere?
1883,1556409839.2866,Priscilla,yes
1883,1556409847.2869,Bethany,Ok so you probably have something like:; None
1883,1556409918.2877,Priscilla,thats right!
1883,1556409919.2879,Bethany,and you want them to pick a list via serial number? Or create this
1883,1556409965.2885,Priscilla,"no it will go straight to a CSV with one exception; no wait, I mean it will all be presented to the user, not picked via a serial number"
1883,1556410017.2896,Hiroko,"<@Frankie> no, what I mean is this:

```line 41, in handle
    with open(filename, 'w') as csv:
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'ACTIVE_USERS_20190427_233356.csv'```; that’s in your management command; its trying to open a file it doesn’t have perms for"
1883,1556410074.2915,Bethany,"<@Priscilla> I'm not quite sure what it is the user is expected to do here. But if you have a dictionary, you can add a key:value pair by simply `d[new_key] = new_value`"
1883,1556410112.2926,Frankie,<@Hiroko> it's trying to open it with WRITE permissions. the file doesn't exist. the code's trying to create it.
1883,1556410121.293,Hiroko,correct; which suggests the user:group of the process running the command doesn’t have access to that directory
1883,1556410156.2946,Frankie,I agree lol; I don't know what that process is though
1883,1556410170.2953,Hiroko,"if you ssh into the instance, with the same group, are you able to `touch some_file.txt` in that directory?"
1883,1556410234.2968,Frankie,"yes, if I sudo, but if I sudo as you can see it gives me a syntax error"
1883,1556410393.2979,Priscilla,"i know, im sorry <@Bethany> let me explain entirely. The user will input some serial numbers (corresponding to connected devices) but there is no set number, they will connect anywhere from 1-10 devices. Each device will run through some tests and pass or fail and at the end I need to display this:"
1883,1556410420.2991,Bethany,oh ok and that is saved to csv as a report or something
1883,1556410426.2994,Priscilla,right
1883,1556410426.2995,Hiroko,then I would suggest you change things so you don’t have to run that command with `sudo`
1883,1556410450.3002,Frankie,that's not the issue.
1883,1556410456.3005,Bethany,"so it sounds to me you don't actually need a dictionary to store the user input, you could use a list or set"
1883,1556410460.3007,Frankie,the command runs fine when I deploy the code because the deploy script runs as root; I was just trying to run it locally on EC2 so I didn't have to keep redeploying cause it saves me waiting for 4 damn minutes just to test changing bucket policies 50 times in a row lol
1883,1556410549.303,Priscilla,"yes, but the data does need to be ordered, like explicitly in that order `serialnumber, [test1], [test2], [test3]` arent sets unordered?"
1883,1556410591.3034,Carmen,"A set is unordered, yes."
1883,1556410710.3038,Frankie,<@Priscilla> `from collections import OrderedDict` ftw!
1883,1556410760.3048,Hiroko,"well, if you’re using python 3.6+, dicts are ordered by insertion; 3.6 made it an implementation detail, 3.7 finalized it in the spec"
1883,1556410803.3057,Bethany,"if you need no duplicates but order doesn't matter, `Set`, if you need duplicates and order matters, `list`; <@Hiroko> i thought that was a Cpython implementation detai"
1883,1556410825.3061,Priscilla,None
1883,1556410828.3066,Hiroko,"in 3.6, yes"
1883,1556410829.3067,Bethany,but it's in the spec now?
1883,1556410833.3069,Hiroko,correct
1883,1556410846.3072,Bethany,oh cool. Still will probably not assume it though
1883,1556410863.3075,Hiroko,&gt;&gt;&gt;the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec.; <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html>
1883,1556410874.3082,Priscilla,ok so then lists it is
1883,1556410894.3089,Bethany,list is a good default choice anyway.
1883,1556410900.3091,Hiroko,"before, it was an implementation detail of cpython, which excludes pypy; but now, its part of the spec"
1883,1556410913.3096,Priscilla,i think i understand lists a little better than the other options
1883,1556411023.3104,Frankie,Maybe I'm missing something cause I was half paying attention to your issue/goal <@Priscilla> but this seems kinda trivial to me...what is your goal for user input and what's the goal for output?; are serialnumber1-4 supposed to be entered by the user?
1883,1556411298.3158,Priscilla,"The goal for input is the serial number of a device then running some functions against it and getting back a pass or fail for each 3 set of functions. Then displaying the serial number and 3 test results to the user. Apparently they will do these devices in a single batch of 10. So the amount of devices (serial number and test results in this convo) may not be a definitive number, ya know?; does that make sense?"

1883,1556411884.3209,Frankie,are serial numbers always numbers or can they have letters/chars too?

1883,1556413995.3501,Carmen,The computer has no idea you want to restrict the input to the active window. It'll let you switch windows with control keys and do anything you could do with a normal keyboard.
1883,1556413997.3502,Priscilla,well is that really a threat with barcodes that we print on there?
1883,1556414029.351,Carmen,"With your barcodes, no, if you trust your barcode system."
1883,1556414030.3512,Priscilla,i mean we make the barcodes.; ok
1883,1556414045.3517,Carmen,But you could have malicious actors adding barcodes to the equipment.; So keep that in mind.
1883,1556414064.3522,Priscilla,good point
1883,1556414110.3529,Carmen,"Though it's worth noting that just as it opens you up to risk, you can also take advantage of that to run very complicated strings of commands/actions from a single barcode scan.; If needed for some reason."

1883,1556414930.3562,Priscilla,break points; it looks like a feature of the theme you have installed to put those boxes around breakpoint codes
1890,1556415040.3577,Priscilla,would you want to use regex to find dupilicates?

1891,1556416164.3699,Rodrick,oh thanks jason
1890,1556416169.3701,Frankie,"that basically says ""always do nothing"""
1891,1556416185.3706,Rodrick,i see
1890,1556416206.372,Frankie,usually `pass` is used if you just want to create a thing but don't know what you want it to do yet.
1890,1556416208.3722,Sasha,"The way I've heard it, `pass` is a blank line for places where a blank line isn't syntactically allowed."
1890,1556416217.3725,Hiroko,one thing its handy for is if you’re making a parent class with method implementations that will come from the subclasses
1890,1556416233.3732,Frankie,"e.g.
```
def some_function():
    # todo: write this function later
    pass
```"
1890,1556416233.3733,Hiroko,so you have a choice of using `pass` or raising `NotImplementedError`
1891,1556416259.3735,Priscilla,is there a way to like stylize a command line program? it would be nice to return a serial number like in real time down a list like:
1890,1556416285.3741,Priscilla,and every scan it pops up an new one
1891,1556416301.3747,Frankie,you could use escape characters like `\n` and `\t`
1890,1556416309.3751,Frankie,to indent/enter new lines in your output
1891,1556416324.3755,Hiroko,"also, handling exceptions"

1891,1556416575.3806,Rodrick,for a class in a definition `def myDefinition(parm)`
1891,1556416582.3811,Priscilla,until now I was using just colorama for readability but i cant achieve that format with it of course
1891,1556416591.3814,Rodrick,do i need a `self` parm; if im not using it?
1890,1556416643.3824,Sasha,Yes. Python is going to give the `self` parameter to your function whether you want it or not.
1890,1556416656.3827,Rodrick,ok
1890,1556416709.3836,Sasha,(This is only for regular method functions defined inside a class. Bare functions by themselves don't have a `self`.)
1890,1556416759.384,Rodrick,Ok
1890,1556416817.3848,Sasha,"Note that if a method doesn't make use of `self`, you may want to consider whether it should be part of the class at all, or perhaps some other type of function."

1893,1556420022.3981,Priscilla,9 hours? eh whats 1 more?
1892,1556420057.3983,Frankie,didn't work :cry: lol; but yea you're right - I already know it's impossible for me to stop at this point; I have to figure it out
1892,1556420497.3998,Priscilla,You should just move on to a work around. You know you will figure it out later. 
1892,1556420679.4004,Frankie,"the workaround is basically ""do it manually"" which is the whole hting I'm trying to avoid lol; I was just trying to set up an automated DB export of active users, customers and subscriptions to CSV so I could then import the users into mailchimp to build my list the first time, but in doing it I figured it'd be nice to just auto-export a copy of everything each time I deploy so I can always jump into S3 and get an updated view of my users, customers, etc; finally figured it out"
1894,1556466016.4033,Bethany,what fixed it
1892,1556470883.4038,Clayton,Mornin'
1892,1556471182.4043,Priscilla,i too would like to know what fixed it <@Frankie>
1892,1556473033.4051,Frankie,"<@Bethany> <@Priscilla> well I don't know if this is right but basically What I ended up doing was assigning the bucket policy to the same user that manages my static files; instead of assigning it to the role of the EC2 instance; I actually even tried creating a new user specifically for managing this bucket but it seems the `boto` library that interfaces w/ the AWS API needs some extra stuff it's not telling you about in terms of permissions; e.g. it might need to read the ACL of the bucket in order to determine if it's allowed to put stuff in it, or whatever ..."
1892,1556473148.4079,Priscilla,"neat, i think i get it. nice job! :smile:"
1892,1556473161.4082,Frankie,"so the static files user has a bunch more permissions but applying the bucket policy to it strips its permissions down to just `PutObject` and `PutObjectAcl`, along with whatever other stuff it (apparently) needs; I tried to get a file from the bucket w/ that user and tried changing the ACL and stuff like that and it denied me which is what I wanted but it is definitely annoying that I don't actually know what permissions it needs and just have to trust that the developer assigned ones that are safe for what I want. Unfortunately the only way to know for sure would be for me to dig into the source of `boto` but tbh I don't care that much lol"
1892,1556473300.4103,Priscilla,lol
1892,1556474174.4106,Frankie,did you get your dictionary thing figured out? <@Priscilla>

1892,1556474239.412,Frankie,what part are you working on?; I had the rest of it sort of figured out in my head but just needed some more info on how you planned to structure things
1895,1556474302.414,Alicia,"Hi everyone,
I have a strange question… there is a way to execute some python code if you import some module?
smthing like:
```
if iscalled('import matplotlib.pyplot' ):
    execute python code
```"
1892,1556474320.4143,Priscilla,"id like each serial number to have its own list, so the only information in each list pertains to that instrument"
1892,1556474365.4153,Chester,<@Alicia> what problem you're trying to solve?
1892,1556474403.4154,Alicia,"the problem is related to this stackoverflow issue

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python>"
1892,1556474413.4158,Frankie,yea that's pretty simple; <@Priscilla> so you need to iterate through the list of serials and create an empty list as the value of that key in a dict
1892,1556474449.4167,Chester,I'm not sure how
1892,1556474468.4172,Alicia,"In my package at the moment I simply solve this running this code in the __init__ files:

1892,1556474605.4201,Frankie,"lots of ways to do it; I quite like the `OrderedDict(zip(keys, vals))` pattern cause it allows you to really see what the vals will be by putting them all in a list; I use it a lot"
1892,1556474771.4214,Chester,There's also `collections.defaultdict`
1892,1556474803.4216,Alicia,"mmm I will try that, maybe is better; thanks"
1892,1556475562.4225,Frankie,"damn you person who registered for my site using your weird alphabet!; now I have to deal with stupid unicode lol; does anyone have a preference for CSV files, whether they use tabs or commas as a delimiter?; commas seem annoying cause for field like location you could end up with stuff like `Los Angeles, CA` which throws off the columsn if you don't quote it.; are tabs generally ""better"" to avoid this or should I just use quotes?"
1892,1556476361.4262,Clayton,"If you asked the average Python coder, would they know the difference between an 'expression' and 'statement'  ?"
1892,1556476392.4264,Frankie,"Average? Probably not. lol; I'd argue even a lot of advanced python coders wouldn't know the difference in terms of a strict definition, but probably understand the concept w/o realizing they do."
1892,1556476520.4278,Sasha,Personally I always go for tab-separated when I have a choice. Avoids all sorts of problems with escaping and quoting.
1892,1556476711.428,Frankie,"that's what I'm thinking too.; is there any risk of spaces being interpreted as tabs in freeform text fields?; only one that's really being a pain is location cause it often has a comma, but I wouldn't put it past an end user to use a tab, for some reason, lol; so I'm thinking I should use tabs, and also quote the location field"
1892,1556476902.4299,Sasha,"If you're handling direct user input, it might be good practice to just do `replace('\t', ' ')` on everything to be safe."
1892,1556476918.4301,Frankie,ok.; it's just this one field so I think I'm just gonna do it in the CSV when I export cause the field isn't super important anyway; but if I wrap the field in quotes won't that prevent the inner tab from being interpreted anyway?
1892,1556476989.4319,Sasha,"Depends on the parser. If someone does `split('\t')`, then quotes are ignored."
1892,1556477012.4322,Frankie,"""someone"" as in another developer?"
1892,1556477164.434,Sasha,"Yeah. It's not obvious whether tab-separated files should allow quotes like comma-separated ones do. I might purposefully use that when I want to have unbalanced quotes in my data, for instance. So it depends on what code consumes the file at the other end."
1892,1556477308.4342,Frankie,my eyeballs consume it :slightly_smiling_face:
1892,1556477352.435,Sasha,"Heh, then do whatever you want. You're unlikely to be confused with the location field anyway."
1892,1556477358.4351,Frankie,"but I think this should cover most cases...?; (also, would just writing a newline be sufficient instead of 14 tabs? lol)"
1892,1556477452.4364,Sasha,"Your `replace` parameter is weird, BTW."
1892,1556477453.4365,Frankie,"probably is no way a tab would ever end up in a username but it's the only other text field so may as well; oh man, yeah you're right haha; `replace('\t', ' ')` like that?; derp.; lol I don't even know what that is up there. What was I even writing? haha; did you happen to notice the question about just writing a newline in the except block?"
1892,1556477657.4385,Sasha,It's not obvious what error you are guarding against in the `try` block. What do you expect to possibly go wrong?
1892,1556477678.4388,Frankie,well originally I was protecting against unicode errors; but I fixed that w/ encoding='utf-8' when opening the file; so now I'm just protecting against basically anything else that could possibly go wrong since an error in this function would prevent the deployment from completing.; and it's not critical that the CSV has EVERY user in it ... I'd be happy with 99% of them since any it misses on is probably not going to be a good user for me to market stuff to anyway since they most likely did something weird/wrong when registering
1892,1556477957.4423,Sasha,"Gotcha. I hesitate to suggest it, but if you're guarding against weird-data stuff like that, you might want the `try` at the start of the loop to potentially catch things like `date_joined` being `None` or whatever.; With regard to newline versus a bunch of tabs, since only your eyes are consuming it, it doesn't matter, heh heh."
1892,1556478525.4434,Frankie,thanks :slightly_smiling_face:; it works :slightly_smiling_face:; it's so purdy heh; good point about the `None` thing btw - however that's an auto-generated field so it should never be `None`; and also I wouldn't want to prevent the whole CSV from being written just cause one user couldn't be written
1892,1556478700.4456,Sasha,"Right, I didn't mean outside of the loop, just at the start of the logic for each profile."
1892,1556478732.446,Frankie,ahh right; ok.; might be a good idea
1892,1556478759.4471,Sasha,You also might consider logging an error message somewhere.
1892,1556478789.4476,Frankie,yeah. I mean it will be logged into the activity log on the server (that's where this print output came from); it's not technically logging but any stdout stuff is maintained in the server's log file; so I can `tail -200 /var/log/eb-activity.log` to see stuff for example
1892,1556478873.4497,Sasha,Gotcha. But right now it just silently skips an invalid profile. You might want to print something if the `except` clause is triggered.
1892,1556478884.4499,Frankie,"ohhh true good point; that's much easier than what I did before which was log into the admin and findthe offending profile based on the ones above/below it, lol; since they are organized in the CSV by date joined it was easy for me to find it but I like your way better; this can definitely be fine tuned now :slightly_smiling_face:; sweeeet 6561 users exported :open_mouth:; I apologize in advance 6,561 times, but mailchimp here I come.; lol"

1898,1556489595.4709,Maricruz,"that looks good to me...is that `test_dict` what you're wanting your end data to look like?; typo on line 12 btw, should be `'test2_results'`"
1898,1556489770.4721,Priscilla,where are those `None` coming from you think? should i just post it all?
1898,1556489873.4725,Maricruz,Ya just post it all - what's your `test_2` function returning?
1898,1556489898.4727,Priscilla,this is gonna hurt; None
1898,1556490121.4744,Sasha,"Yeah, line 138: `out = print(report(serials))`. The return value of `print()` is `None`."
1898,1556490123.4745,Maricruz,"In the function `test_2`, you're not actually calling any of the sub functions; so `test_2` isn't going to return anything (i.e. it returns `None`; Oh nvm, I can't read"
1898,1556490250.4761,Sasha,"Line 131 isn't what you want either: `if oct_power_reset_flag and ocm1_power_reset_flag and relay1_temp_set == True:`... you're not calling the functions, just referencing the functions themselves."
1898,1556490260.4763,Maricruz,Right right ^^^
1898,1556490277.4766,Priscilla,working on it; changed it; oh my god; holy; shit it work\ed; :face_with_monocle: is the `none` in outputs coming from line156?
1898,1556490940.4791,Maricruz,"line 156 is actually unnecessary I think, you can delete it"

1898,1556491147.48,Maricruz,"<@Priscilla> I'm not exactly sure but I think you should remove the `print` from `passed = print('    ' + sn_str + '    PASS - TEST 2')`  and `failed`; just do `passed = '       ' + sn_str + '       PASS -TEST2'`; if you want to print your results to the console, you don't need to store them in a dictionary like I recommended; have `test_2` return a string then when looping through your serials you can just do"
1898,1556491244.4821,Priscilla,its going to be entirely console based
1898,1556491253.4823,Maricruz,"```

1898,1556491453.4843,Sasha,"BTW, your mental model of `and` is a little off. `if foo and bar and baz == True` evaluates like `if (foo) and (bar) and (baz == True)`, i.e. it's doing some ""truthiness"" checks and an equality check first, then `and`ing the results."
1898,1556491466.4846,Priscilla,"<@Maricruz> i like that much more, simpler code; <@Sasha> i didnt know that! thanks for letting me know; yes! removed the `None` didnt kneed the var at 140"

1898,1556493787.4889,Priscilla,"so i have a `while True:` loop in my main, and it constantly prints out the pass/fail to the console, if i wanted it to only print when finished I would need to place that `while True` in the `test_2` function, does that sound right?"
1898,1556493847.4894,Sasha,"You would probably want to accumulate the output in a string variable, and then print it at the end.; Or use the test results in the dict to create the output after all the testing has been done."
1898,1556494325.4903,Priscilla,"ill go with the former, dont have dicts anymore"
1898,1556494695.4907,Frankie,"damn I have so many API keys for various stuff it's getting kinda annoying. lol; mailchimp, aws, iex, newsapi, quandl, alphavantage ... seems like the list is neverending to the point I'm about to just create a `keys.py` and import it :smile:"
1900,1556495713.492,Priscilla,"it doesnt like this, why doesnt it like this?"
1898,1556496211.4939,Sasha,"Same mental-model problem you had with `and`. The `or` operator has to deal with full self-contained expressions, not referencing variables elsewhere in the line. You want `if float_tp4 &gt;= 13.1 or float_tp4 &lt;= 16.5:`. Note also that it's `&gt;=` rather than `=&gt;`."
1898,1556496398.495,Priscilla,aha
1900,1556496399.4951,Sasha,"And note that this will be true for any float value. Did you want it to be the other way around, such that the value is between 13.1 and 16.5?"
1898,1556496412.4953,Priscilla,in between
1900,1556496444.496,Priscilla,i changed them though
1898,1556496462.4964,Sasha,There's a handy shortcut for that: `if 13.1 &lt;= float_tp4 &lt;= 16.5`. Or you can do it with an `and` clause.
1900,1556496532.4967,Priscilla,your way is much more readable i think; what do you think? I am going to run this for all of the test points then use a function called `report()` to check all the test points to be true or false. and if any are false then `report()` will return `FAIL`
1900,1556496915.4979,Sasha,"You should probably get into the habit of searching for `""= print""` in your code. Every time you do that, it's a mistake, since `print()` always returns `None`."
1900,1556497005.4986,Priscilla,is this the correct way?
1900,1556497038.4991,Sasha,Yep. You can also just `return 'pass'` if you want to.

1900,1556498824.0078,Priscilla,what was the notch for? why didnt they machine it with the notch?
1900,1556498887.0088,Frankie,man this integration is so freakin cool
1900,1556498907.0095,Sasha,"The notch was a write-protect tab... open for writeable, or you could cover it up with tape to write-protect it. Single-sided floppies were cheaper, and you could usually use them as double-sided if you cut a second notch and flipped them over."

1900,1556499627.018,Priscilla,trying chromium; nope; just firefox on win10 with 1 extention installed; works on edge C:
1900,1556499738.0197,Frankie,works fine for me on firefox...lol are you getting that error when using the email confirmation link or when actually logging in?; seems like a bug in how firefox is handling CSRF verification; but it works for me so maybe that extension is causing a problem?
1900,1556499781.0209,Priscilla,just typing in the url and clikcing 'login;; dashlane is the extention
1900,1556499890.0217,Frankie,it could be messing w/ CSRF; if it's intercepting the request and passing it along; fwiw I build/develop it on Chrome; I gotta go at the moment but if you try disabling dashlane and it works then let me know. I'll see if I can work out a fix; first time I've seen that and the site has been live for like a year lol

1900,1556500056.0249,Frankie,interesting.; that extension must be forging the request then so this is actually expected behavior for the CSRF verification
1900,1556500115.026,Priscilla,i use it to automatically fill and login... idk if you kewn that.
1900,1556500133.0262,Frankie,"nope I didn't; but that's why; CSRF prevents the site from allowing a login from any site that doesn't have a valid CSRF token (which only exists at runtime when you submit the form from the site); there may be an option in dashlane to pass the token along or something actually; but it's designed as a security precaution so that random sites can't send requests to login and do stuff; when you run the login page, it generates a random token that gets passed in a hidden field in the form when you click submit; if that token is invalid for example if another site intercepted and messed w/ the request, it will return that 403 forbidden message; but that reminds me I need to Add a 403 template so it doesn't display the exact reason for the failure lol; but at least DEBUG didn't spit out all the site settings and environment variables :smile:; anyway I gotta run, girlfriend is waiting for me to come over! ttyl and thanks for troubleshooting!; btw that function will return Pass if your tp4 function call returns True ... that's all I can tell in about 10 seconds of looking at it. lol"

1906,1556545895.0665,Hiroko,"<@Ming> spyder is an IDE, and doesn’t have anything to do with the execution of your program; that’s passed off to the python interpreter you’re using; and profiling programs is definitely a bit of a black art; one thing you can try to do is ensure you have the C/C++ dependencies for python libs installed; for example, if you’re running numpy and doing linalg, having BLAS installed locally will have a major speedup vs having numpy run all those calcs in pure python"
1906,1556546254.0698,Ming,"Okay. I know which bit is significantly slowing down the running of the script. Maybe someone can help me see whether there would be a more efficient way of doing this?; `list_indexes_master_dataframe = master_dataframe.index.values.tolist()`

`for each in NAN_indexes:`
   ` if each &lt; master_dataframe.index[-1] and each &gt; 180000:`

          `  master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'`; Basically I have a dataframe with data that has been downsampled -&gt; master_dataframe
And I have a list of indexes where the data point was a nan (before applying interpolation)
On a different column (called 'nans CH') I want to write 'nan' next to the new interpolated value; So if a value in the dataframe with the data was nan before, I want to write a 'nan' next to it (on the same row, thus using the same index)"
1906,1556546748.0766,Clemmie,"I’m guessing that iterating through `list_index_ master_dataframe` to look up if `each` is in it is slowing you down a bunch. If the values in `list_index_ master_dataframe` are unique you can speed up your work by making that a dict, with all the values the keys, and an empty value. This will speed it up because you are going from O(n) for the list evaluation to amortized O(1) dict key lookup; also - I don’t know dataframes so well - but to me `master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'` sure looks like it is doing a lookup. You can probably get rid of `if each in list_indexes_master_dataframe:` and just wrap `master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'` in a try/except"
1906,1556546927.0785,Ming,Yep. The second part makes sense. I implemented a try/except now; But I didn't understand well making the list of indexes into a dictionary; The values in `list_index_ master_dataframe` are unique

1906,1556550062.0985,Nola,"is there a way to merge by ""right_index=True,"" and by a date column?"
1908,1556550350.0988,Blythe,My operating system is Windows
1906,1556550362.099,Marth,there is `how='right'`  (instead of left) but I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for?  I'm also not sure where/how you want to use the date col?  Can you provide some sample data?
1906,1556550400.0992,Clemmie,"I don’t know windows very well, but you can ask in <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> if anyone knows of a program to override it"
1908,1556550511.0995,Marth,<@Nola> you may want to also look at: <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html#combining-joining-merging>
1906,1556550611.0997,Nola,"yes, the issue I'm having is I have two DF's and they Both have ['ID'] and ['Date'] and i want to join them but having trouble"
1908,1556551290.0999,Marth,I'm guessing the pandas `merge` function is what you're probably looking for.  It's hard to know for sure without knowing more of your data.  You may want to have a look at merge (from the link I posted above).  Keeping in mind you can provide a list to the `right_on` and `left_on` options.
1906,1556551452.1001,Marth,"you may look into this sort of syntax (untested, so it may not work or be the solution you're looking for): `right_on=[['ID', 'Date']]`  I can't remember if that's correct syntax or if `right_on=['ID', 'Date']` is the right way, but I think you get the idea that you can provide merge with a list"
1910,1556553545.1006,Lorenzo,"Hi all - I am a bit new to python but hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction with a python project I am interested in - <https://github.com/kenkeiter/lantern> is a project to control a specific bluetooth light - however, when I follow the steps to install this and run the sample code on the github page, it tells me “ImportError: cannot import name Light” - hoping someone much more experienced than me can tell me whats wrong with that page"
1910,1556554379.1019,Frankie,"soo - anyone wanna do some sleuthing for me? I'm a part time mentor for a software dev company and I suspect one of my students has copied his entire project from somewhere else. anyone know if there's a way to tell if a github repo was cloned/copied even if it's not forked?; basically the entire project is 95% finished in the first commit, dude doesn't speak good english, yet his readme is perfect english, lol, and the whole project uses tons of concepts and tech not taught in the course he would have taken.; he didn't fork the repo from anywhere, that was the first thing I checked, but I suspect he cloned/copied it from somewhere and just uploaded it as his own which would be bad"
1910,1556554498.1045,Carmen,That sounds like picking a few whole sentences and doing a site-search via Google.; Toss me the repo link and I'll poke at it.
1910,1556554531.1055,Frankie,yeah I did that in the readme for one or two sentences but couldn't find anything - I'm still trying cause I really don't believe this dude did it himself. lol; I'll PM the repo to anyone but want to keep it out of this chat just cause I don't wanna throw him under the bus if he did do it himself by some miracle :smile:
1910,1556554603.1068,Clemmie,sounds like fun - toss it my way too
1910,1556554675.1071,Frankie,"thanks guys, link sent! detective internet is on the case; to be fair his other readmes are also good, so it's possible he outsourced the work and just paid someone to do it for him, lol"
1910,1556554886.1095,Elanor,that's also a reasonable suspicion; there are definitely a lot of services out there that help people with interviews including coding problems; so he could have just tossed some cash to one of those services
1910,1556554974.1118,Jimmy,afaik you can kill the fork relationships on github; or just fork and upload elsewhere
1910,1556554987.1124,Frankie,"other facts that make me feel this is not his work: first time he sent me the repo it was awful ... env files everywhere, literal command line commands somehow in the repo (e.g. there was a file called `python app.py` as if he'd tried to type it into the command line, lol) lib/site-packages in the repo, files all out of order ... just looked like he tried to clone it and it didn't work right away so he started trying to make it work and broke it even worse. He then came to me asking for help, I told him the project was basically all over the place and he needed to start over and go back to the course materials, he assured me it was all his work after I questioned it that time and said he would redo it...3 days later, this giant project all in one commit again like he did it all in three days? this guy is a student, not a seasoned developer so it makes me question this a lot."
1910,1556555036.1128,Elanor,you could start asking questions regarding why he made the decisions he did; ask him to explain certain parts of the code to you in detail; treat it like an interview; he should be able to explain the decisions that were made and the structure of the code
1910,1556555132.1156,Frankie,that's exactly what I plan to do today when I meet w/ him. Just going to tell him to take me through his code and explain what it does.
1910,1556555133.1157,Clemmie,Even if he did hire someone to write it - oof that `Quantity` model
1910,1556555186.1165,Frankie,but I'm pretty sure <@Sasha> just nailed it - sent me another repo that looks pretty much identical and it's a past submission from another student that took the same course. yikes.
1910,1556555201.1167,Clemmie,show us!!!
1910,1556555234.117,Elanor,Ooooh

1910,1556555252.1185,Frankie,this is def a copied project. all he did is change the CSS lol

1910,1556555285.1194,Clemmie,<@Sasha> :taco:
1910,1556555298.1198,Claudine,that's unfortunate :disappointed:
1910,1556555317.1201,Leana,None
1910,1556555320.1203,Claudine,why take courses to cheat :disappointed:
1910,1556555335.1208,Elanor,because you're forced to? Because you don't actually care?
1910,1556555347.1215,Frankie,<@Sasha> you now get credit for making this guy fail the course. lol; I blame you.
1910,1556555351.122,Carlo,"let's be honest though, htat guy is probably not the sharpest tool in the shed"
1910,1556555351.1221,Elanor,I mean I don't do that but I get that some people just don't give a shit and are forced to for whatever reason
1910,1556555389.1239,Frankie,but I mean really if you're gonna cheat WHY take the code from someone who took the same course and submitted it to the same assessors...like they weren't going to notice?!!?
1910,1556555392.1241,Carlo,"after the first suspicion, he still submits a plagiarized project; that doesnt show a lot of foresight lol"
1910,1556555417.1252,Frankie,well the thing is I'm not actually an assessor ... he hasn't actually submitted it yet.; so I MIGHT be able to save him lol
1910,1556555424.1257,Clemmie,"<@Elanor> sure - but at least hide it better (not condoning). Now he is going to fail, possibly be kicked out, and if not maybe have to take it again"
1910,1556555433.126,Elanor,I agree; I just think back to when I was in college taking bullshit GenEd courses; I guarantee to you some of them meant nothing in the grand scheme of things; at least for me
1910,1556555473.1277,Frankie,I am going to tell him absolutely do not do not do not submit it and DO THE PROJECT YOURSELF or else he is gonna end up failing and forfeiting the $6k he paid for the course ...
1910,1556555498.1289,Elanor,can you at least livestream the part where you show him the code he copied from?
1910,1556555499.129,Carlo,lol @ risking $6k over laziness
1910,1556555526.1301,Diego,Google interview in python or java?
1910,1556555541.1311,Clemmie,and then send him a link to <#C64GEEM7U|job_advice> to see that even people who actually do the work and know this stuff can have a hard time finding a job
1910,1556555542.1312,Frankie,"I feel bad cause I suspect a lot of the reason he did this is he can't speak english very well. He is trying to better his life learning a new language and a new skill which I'm sure makes it very hard to understand the course material, but dude...ask for help. I'll help you lol; or we'll get someone who speaks your language to help"
1911,1556555591.1324,Clemmie,<@Diego> are you asking what they interview in? you might want to bring it up in <#C64GEEM7U|job_advice>
1910,1556555607.1326,Diego,already did; danke
1910,1556555726.1334,Frankie,alright well thanks internet sleuths for confirming my suspicions. I :heart: the internets; and while I would love to livestream of the ensuing awkwardness I don't think that would be very professional of me lol
1910,1556555804.1345,Elanor,"Well no, you went and humanized him so now the enjoyment factor is gone"
1910,1556555820.1349,Frankie,I know right :disappointed:
1910,1556555828.1351,Elanor,"now it's ""guy trying to learn english and new skills"" and not just ""lazy jackass trying to cheat through class"""
1910,1556555850.1355,Frankie,"I know. It's like making fun of a kindergartner :disappointed:; lol; I can't do that; I hope he can get over this hump though and actually make something of himself. He's from a pretty bad area of the world so I can appreciate the struggle but this can't fly unfortunately lol; hopefully this will be one of those stories where ""can't speak english, couldn't even write a line of code, cheated on first project...then went on to develop <http://Google.com|Google.com> and became a multibillionaire"" :smile:"

given a range (A, B) (0&lt;A&lt;B), return a number X so that: ```A &lt; X &lt; B or -B &lt; X &lt; -A``` [EDITED]
I want the distribution to be uniform. I don't really care about the inequality (can be either `&lt;` or `&lt;=`).
I can use Numpy if that helps.
So far I have come up with something the smells too complex to me: ```
    s, e = 3, 5
    w = e - s  # the range's width = 2
    rnd = random.random() * 2 * w  # will give a number between 0 and 4
    rnd -= w  # will center the range to be between -2 and 2
    rnd += (s if rnd &gt; 0 else -s)
```

1912,1556562963.1489,Ouida,no... range gives an integer range of numbers... I need a single number

1912,1556562973.1494,Claudine,"yea just pick a single number from that range; so long as your `a` is less than your `b` it should work, if `b` is less than `a` `range` will return nothing and your thing will ded; or
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randrange(a,b)

1912,1556563561.1528,Claudine,oh i assumed he meant `-X` for that side; brain just added that `-` on it's own
1912,1556563668.1537,Ouida,"<@Sasha> I don't understand - what's impossible? note that I said `0 &lt; A &lt; B`.; <@Claudine> I want a uniform distribution in the following split range: `(-B, -A), (A, B)` and I don't care of it's inclusive or exclusive from either side."
1912,1556563757.1556,Clemmie,"but you are asking for X &lt; -A, X &gt; A.; Assuming A &gt; -A, then X &lt; -A &lt; A &lt; X; so… X &lt; X"
1912,1556563839.1571,Ouida,OK OK sorry :slightly_smiling_face: I meant OR. The returned value of the requested function should be somewhere in that range. See the example code I posted. It's working. I just wanted something that looks nicer.; I'm editing the original message

1923,1556634727.2083,Clemmie,you need the escape spaces in paths with `/` - much easier to just not have them; can you move that folder to `Whale_2.0` or `Whale2.0`?; whitespace is the bane of file structure navigation
1923,1556634834.2096,Conchita,"Noted, and tried. But same result"
1923,1556634863.2098,Clemmie,same error?
1923,1556634880.21,Emelda,How would I find files with a specific extension in a directory using os module
1923,1556634939.2103,Conchita,"Yes ```touch /Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale2.0/collect/data/pot/pot_300419.csv

1923,1556635109.2125,Clemmie,<@Emelda> you want to use `[f for f in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isfile(f)]` to get all the files in the current directory and use a regex or simple string matching to match on the extension of choice
1923,1556635127.2132,Conchita,And I'm finding all the other files there when using `ls`
1923,1556635128.2133,Clemmie,"<@Conchita> now that you are in it can you `touch` the file name, or even `touch a`?"
1923,1556635231.2141,Conchita,"Yes, while in the dir, I could successfully `touch` the file name; Which created an empty csv file"
1923,1556635302.2148,Clemmie,`rm`  the file and try the script again for me?; be fore you run the script do `cd ~` and then `cd` back into the script folder

1923,1556635753.2188,Conchita,"Nice eyes; this is my dir structure:; ```Whale2.0
--\init.py
--\collect
    --\cryptoid.py (the script)
--\data
    --\pot (the dir the script should create the file in)
        --\ x```; Maybe because I cd into collect, that it gave off this traceback?"
1923,1556635951.2227,Clemmie,"ok - so that `ROOT_DIR` bit won’t work because it is giving you the root of the script, but the script is in a different section of the tree than where you want the data.; wait…; I’m confused by the naming of collect.py and cryptoid.py - is cryptoid in a folder called collect, and the collect folder is a sibling to a file called collect.py?"
1923,1556636100.2252,Conchita,"Sorry - `collect.py` should be `collect` - its a directory, not a script"
1923,1556636117.2256,Clemmie,"ok, so what i said above is the same"
1923,1556636170.2263,Conchita,"Yes, I must change the `ROOT_DIR`"
1923,1556636175.2265,Clemmie,replace csv_dir with `csv_path = os.path.split(ROOT_DIR)[0] + f'/data/{coin}/{coin}_{todays_date}.csv'`; `split` splits the terminal folder from the tree into a tuple

1925,1556641490.2459,Emelda,I would like to do this all in python without having to rely on the shell honestly
1925,1556641658.2461,Clemmie,"try the triple quotes, that may work. The recommended way to execute shell command is `subprocess.call()` instead of `os.system()` - you may want to look into that"
1925,1556641674.2463,Emelda,What's the difference?
1925,1556641728.2465,Clemmie,"from the `os.system` docs:
&gt;The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function. See the Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section in the subprocess documentation for some helpful recipes.’"
1925,1556641734.2467,Emelda,nvm quick google search told me; But yea that
1926,1556642382.2486,Sasha,"I'm not completely sure I understand what makes them ""not good"", but one thing which pops out is that they reference `self.dataframe`, which doesn't seem to exist. Perhaps you want your `__init__` routine to grab its `dataframe` argument and save it as `self.dataframe`?; You're also sort of using the class like just a nested function, doing a bunch of computation and output in the `__init__` function and then discarding the object afterwards. It's not technically wrong, but it's unexpected."
1927,1556644485.2503,Nenita,"yea i fixed the self.dataframe portion. i just notice i have function calls that are just bare.; So the first line works fine. Printing the row data shows it inserts just fine, however the second line runs fine, but doesn't insert the data if i print the row data? What am I doing wrong?; nvm; just saw my dictionary isnt built properly; alright so my code works fine and all, but when exporting my dataframe, it doesn't retain the values that have been inserted?; if i print the row data as the code is running, it will show that the data has been inserted into the correct location, but it doesn't show any data was inserted after exporting the dataframe"
1927,1556646007.2536,Sasha,"Sounds like you've done something to duplicate the dataframe along the way, and are exporting a different variable than the one you're modifying.; Some Pandas calls return a new dataframe rather than modify the original."
1927,1556646099.2552,Nenita,"ive never encountered this issue before and i just insert the same df into each function.; its the same code as above, but just with the fixed 'self.dataframe'"
1927,1556646186.2562,Sasha,Can you post your revised `__init__`?
1927,1556646189.2563,Nenita,im gunna try something real quick as a test; sure; not much revision tbh though; this is the line i use when inserting my df to be used across all functions; im gunna change the dataframe.to_csv to payroll.to_csv and see if that makes a difference; nope no change; wth :thinking_face:
1927,1556646355.2588,Sasha,"Can you check the timestamp on your output .CSV file? I'm suspicious of the backslash in the filename, so it may not be being saved where you think it should be.; Oh, never mind, raw string."
1927,1556646406.2597,Nenita,"other than the data coming from pyodbc, i may be able to make some changes so you can run it for yourself.; yea give me a sec. ill set this up so you can run it from your end if you choose to"
1927,1556646618.2613,Sasha,"Ah, I think I see the problem. The documentation for `iterrows()` says, ""You should never modify something you are iterating over. This is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Depending on the data types, the iterator returns a copy and not a view, and writing to it will have no effect."" So when you are changing `data[]` values, it isn't necessarily getting propagated into the dataframe."
1927,1556646640.2615,Nenita,"ah that makes sense.; so will i need to use csv reader?; wait. i may just need a return on the iterrows(); so it returns the new copy; omg, even putting the df.to_csv at the end of my iterrows() it still doesnt export the copy"
1927,1556646953.2644,Sasha,"Yeah, the trouble is there isn't any ""copy""... each data value is getting discarded the next time through the loop. You may want to consider creating a new dataframe as you go, or else iterating through the primary keys and modifying the dataframe row in-place."

It seems like you could speed things up if you take a look at <https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#filtering-and-sorting-processes> - passing just one or two attributes, and doing and `info` dict lookup instead of calling the `.name()` method might make things faster"

1933,1556664480.2927,Jamison,"<@Priscilla> why would you want to, as opposed to returning that variable"

1933,1556664642.2966,Sasha,"You can't generally ""grab"" variables from within functions. You can (a) use a global variable, (b) have the function return the data, or (c) pass in some kind of container to the function for it to modify. Sometimes this sort of need is also a sign that you may want to have the functions as part of a class with shared state."
1933,1556664695.2972,Priscilla,"i looked into that and I dont really understand shared states, and not even really classes; unfortunately I dont have time to try and implement that right now ya know"
1933,1556664780.2989,Sasha,"A class is ""smart data"", in that it can store things, but also knows how to do things with that data. For instance, a list is a class... it stores objects, but it also knows how to `sort()` itself."
1933,1556664814.2991,Priscilla,oh; looking it upo; so would i wrap a class and all functions in a for loop and let it spit out the results of each device?
1934,1556664999.3011,Carmen,<@Shirley> Task Scheduler is as reliable as the platform you're running it on. It's the standard for running things at a specific time on Windows.

1933,1556665140.3035,Sasha,"I don't know whether you want to try it here, but the pattern might be to have a class which represents each device. It knows its own serial number, it knows how to run tests on itself, it keeps the test results as part of its own data, and when asked it can print out all of that."

1934,1556666034.3118,Carmen,This project is sounding roughly like a piece of software I helped implement years ago for a tool calibration company. The technicians would go on-site and be calibrating individual tools. They'd have to manually do the testing on the piece of equipment (making measurements against known standards) and then record their results by typing them into the software. Is that similar to what you're doing here?

1942,1556770710.4144,Sasha,"Okay, the simplest form of a `for` loop allows you to repeat a section of code for a sequence of values. For instance:
```nums = [1, 2, 3]
for x in nums:
  print(x)```
would output:
```1
2
3```; So you can use this to execute your `requests` code for each URL in your list.; Appending strings together just uses the `+` operator, like `""a"" + ""b""` produces `""ab""`.; I feel that I should tell you that the cybersecurity program you're enrolled in is likely to get exponentially more difficult than this sort of initial exercise."

1954,1556805910.4457,Alicia,"Hi guys,
maybe it’s a dumb question, but do you know if it is possible to use a shared `__init__.py` file across modules?"
1954,1556805975.4466,Hiroko,"an `__init__.py` file just says to the interpreter that “hey, this is a python package, not a regular directory/folder” and allows for imports; if you have logic in `__init__.py` that you want shared, pull it out into a `something.py` file and you can import it into modules"
1954,1556806403.4507,Alicia,"hi <@Hiroko>,
I thought that __init__.py could also be used to execute some logic at module import phase, as the first action…

In particular my logic is the following:

```
# This piece of code is needed to fix a bug in matplotlib on MacOs
# see: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python>
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
if sys.platform == 'darwin':
    import matplotlib

    if 'matplotlib' in sys.modules:
        matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
```

so what you say is that I should move that in a specific python file, and then import that file in every module?"
1954,1556806558.4517,Bethany,I think the kind of thing you're showing here is ok. It's basically import configuration; Matplotlib has to do this kind of stuff since it depends on system renderers/drawers/whatever it's called
1954,1556806625.4533,Hiroko,:yep:
1954,1556806674.4537,Chester,"```
    import matplotlib

   if 'matplotlib' in sys.modules:
```
This `if` seems useless"
1954,1556806709.4538,Alicia,yeah probably :smile:; they call them backends
1954,1556806875.4551,Bethany,Are you asking to repeat this logic everywhere matplotlib is imported?
1954,1556807167.456,Chester,"I usually have a `main` function which i call in
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```; I'd put that matplotlib configuration in there; I mean, in `main` function.; (it's okay to have it in a separate function - but it has to be called from within `main`); I don't like such side-effects on import time"

PATH is a place from which windows OS recognizes commands; any command that you give, needs to have its original full path in PATH for it to work on command line in one single word.; For example, if you check your python installation, and say it was installed in a directory(file structure) in `C&gt; Program Files &gt; my software &gt; python `, then on command line if you type
`&gt;&gt; C&gt; Program Files &gt; my software &gt; python  --version` it will give you the version, which means you are initialising it using full path to the exact location; in order to short cut that whole directory structure, we add it to the PATH, and then use one keyword to symbolize the whole path(C&gt; Program Files &gt; my software &gt; python).; _HOW TO ADD?_; <https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/>

1980,1557011480.0431,Priscilla,"oh yeah; But i do know how many ports, and I will be allowed to define the order of inputting serial numbers. So if com ports 1-3 all apply to the first serial number and 4-6 apply to the second serial number, and so on until 10 serial numbers."
1980,1557011814.0466,Sasha,"Depends on how the com ports get assigned, I guess."
1980,1557011829.0469,Priscilla,so then I need it to run this class on the first serial number (on each 3 ports within that class) and then iterate to the next serial number; what do you mean?
1980,1557011922.0487,Sasha,"Well, if these are USB devices, the com ports would typically get dynamically assigned based on the order that things are plugged in, or discovered. If this is some special-purpose machine with 30 RS-232 ports on expansion cards, then the ports would probably correspond 1:1 with the physical connectors. I'm not sure what kind of devices you're dealing with."
1980,1557012027.0498,Priscilla,"im sorry, the comports will not change, its usb to rs232 and the usb will stay in at all times with the rs232 only changing, and the pc doesnt even register that; com ports are static in this scenario, thank god lol"
1980,1557012096.0508,Sasha,Gotcha. Just watch out for everything being maybe scrambled when you reboot.
1980,1557012115.051,Priscilla,"good point; so then I could apply the serial numbers to a list, that list has 3 of the com ports and then within the class itterate the function through the list of serial numbers.; no outside of the class I would itterate serial numbers and within the class itterate com ports by 3"
1980,1557012318.0539,Sasha,"Each class instance would want to know its own serial number and the 3 ports it uses, yeah."

1997,1557134761.1522,Dawn,"Hey guys, I'm relatively new to Python. I guess I know the basics and I can write some code - but just started with design patterns etc.

Currently I'm working on an ETL project in which we take JSON files and send them into an Azure database. Each JSON has its own custom mapping of fields to Azure tables and columns. So I'm working with one big json_mapper.py file which has a bunch of if/elif/else statements to check which mapping has to be used.

As I understand, this would be a good situation for a factory method. I'd like to refactor this to a nice and clean method, but to be honest I don't really know where to start. I've done some reading into factory methods, but the custom mapping per JSON, which is sometimes very custom, is the hardest part for me. I'm not really sure where to put that etc.

Does anyone have any pointers for me? A direction to where I should / could start?"

1997,1557135587.1626,Chester,"<@Dawn> okay, so you think your code is ugly mostly because it violates the single responsibility principle, a lot :slightly_smiling_face:
I see thee different blocks of code that should be extracted into their own functions:
1) `doc`, `question` and `answers` parsing logic - some fields are optional, some fields need to be converted, etc.
2) mapping between parsed `doc` fields and `target` fields
3) I/O, data insertion into the database; Once you extract parsing logic into its own function, you'll be able to implement mapping as a static dictionary; e.g.
```
MAPPED_FIELDS = {
    '_id': 'ID',
    'createdAt': 'CreatedAt',
    ...
}
mapped = {}
for key, value in parsed_doc.items():
    mapped_key = MAPPED_FIELDS[key]
    mapped[mapped_key] = value

We presented several forms that created the `Question` model with the right schema; i.e a form with `max_length`, `min_value` etc. These are all just `**kwargs` to a `Field` instance.

2001,1557150741.2085,Hiroko,<https://askubuntu.com/questions/842773/ubuntu-server-and-networkmanager>; doesn’t seem like networkmanager is installed by default on server
2001,1557150984.2104,Talia,"A bit of help? In pure python, i have a list of dicts. Each dict has a key `name`. How can i find how many duplicated values of the `name` key exist?; Example code: ```[{'_id': ObjectId('5cd009d5ba4270be3808d0f4'), 'name': 'jegug'}, {'_id': ObjectId('5cd009d9ba4270be3808da68'), 'name': 'nifev', {'_id': ObjectId('5cd009d6ba4270be3808d39d'), 'name': 'tohez'}]```"
2001,1557151038.2111,Clemmie,"Do you want to know how many unique names there are, or how many different names are duplicated?"
2001,1557151075.2122,Talia,"Actually i want to know, how many similarities there are"
2001,1557151075.2123,Clemmie,"so names `[a,b,b, c,c,c]` would be 3 unique names, but 2 duplicated names"
2001,1557151106.2127,Talia,in your list i want to get the number 5
2001,1557151126.2132,Clemmie,"so `[b,b,c,c,c]`?; ok, let me think for a minute"
2001,1557151139.2138,Talia,"just the number 5 is ok, without the list or anything"
2001,1557151157.2143,Clemmie,"yeah, I meant that 5 was referring to that list of names"
2001,1557151166.2145,Talia,i tried this one `len(self.person.name) &gt; len(set(self.person.name))` but didnt work
2001,1557151192.2151,Clemmie,"no, that wouldn,t, because you loose the multiple duplicates.; One minute"
2001,1557151229.2158,Talia,"thanks a lot! I’m pretty new in Python, so i’m sorry if i say something weird"
2001,1557151548.216,Clemmie,"None; So, going throuigh this; `Counter` is a special dict type that maintains a counter as the var for all the keys that it sees. This uses a list comprehension to extract the names out of your dict and instantiate/populate a Counter with them"
2001,1557151634.2182,Christa,Hey all
2001,1557151645.2185,Clemmie,Then it uses the `sum` function with a list comprehension to sum the list of values (counts) that are greater than 1

2001,1557151799.2226,Christa,I'm having an issue with a python script in which when i'm asked for input and i enter for example 'this is a test' (no quotes) the string is split into words instead of returning a single string

2002,1557156058.2287,Nenita,have you maybe tried .join? <@Christa>
2001,1557161819.231,Sasha,"<@Christa> I'm somewhat confused, since there doesn't seem to be anything in your code which would produce that result. Have you edited out some lines of code which might be doing other stuff to the `user_input` variable?"
2001,1557162292.2316,Clemmie,Also that `try/except` block as written is unnecessary
2003,1557162602.2323,Sasha,Can you show an example? The `\W` should already be removing quotes within the string.

2002,1557166248.2348,Damien,you forgot the `self` parameter

2002,1557166259.2352,Nenita,"yea, dict is called from a function but ill be changing along with so much more, but atm setting to this is what causes the error."
2002,1557166330.2366,Damien,that isn't even a valid block of code
2002,1557166331.2369,Clemmie,while you can do `x = y = z` I don’t think that is what you are meaning to do
2002,1557166341.2374,Damien,you can't assign to a list
2002,1557166347.2377,Clemmie,^ beat me to it
2002,1557166350.2379,Sasha,I think you want `mydict[data['Customer Code']]` without the equals.
2002,1557166366.2383,Nenita,ahh! i see where i went wrong; my_dict[data]; duh; i hate it when i miss simple things
2002,1557166423.2399,Clemmie,nm
2002,1557166438.2403,Nenita,sorry to bother about something so simple. thanks
2004,1557167418.2408,Nenita,what kind of casing is proper/preferred for dictionary keys?
2004,1557167503.2413,Damien,"is all the keys come from code, lower, with underscores for words"
2004,1557167587.2416,Hiroko,"basically, `snake_case`"

2007,1557180666.2531,Gemma,"Firstly, I would try to get the encoding if possible from which you can supply `.decode()` with an `encoding=blahblah` argument. You can also supply an `errors=ignore`, which will skip over bad bytes and from this you may be able to get a sense for what the encoding is."

Started learning to code with Think Python and fell in love with it, but wound up getting hired for a devops role in a Ruby house. Only now, after two years, looping back around to my first love, and have what's probably an entry-level question:; ```class Hexacopter:

2012,1557238028.2763,Leida,i tried `from facenet.src import facenet` and `from .facenet.src import facenet` and `from ..facenet.src import facenet`; added `__init__.py` to app to make it a module and tried a few variations and still didnt get it right xD; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14057464/relative-importing-modules-from-parent-folder-subfolder> seems to explain it but i fail to wrap my brain around it
2012,1557238134.2798,Ashley,"So the other package is able to do an absolute import because python understands it's all a package. It sounds like that won't work for you because you don't have an actual package yet that Python would recognize; When you do `from .facenet`, you're saying ""from my current package level"", but there is no facenet package inside facenet/src; You don't need to reference the facenet package though. You just need to get to a namespace that has what you want. So you just need to go another level up with `..`"
2012,1557238420.283,Leida,"but that returns ```   from ..facenet.src import facenet
ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package

2012,1557238538.2844,Clemmie,"what is the path of the script you are in, and the path of what you are importing? Please indicate the top level that has `__init__.py`"
2012,1557238566.2849,Leida,i have played around having init in app and not having it; the example im looking at does not have init in the main app folder; the script is in `app/src`; im running it from `app`
2012,1557238652.2879,Marth,<@Jung> I think you're looking to do something like `df2 = df.dropna(subset=['emails'])`
2012,1557238653.2881,Leida,as `python src/application.py args`
2012,1557238669.2884,Clemmie,so in python3 you don’t always need an `init` but the time you do/don’t are fairly confusing
2012,1557238711.2886,Ashley,"ah, i just reread the file names; I also forgot about the implicit namespace packages; looks like the only time you need the `__init__.py` is if it wouldn't be empty; <@Leida> try running that command from another directory up (with the right file location)"

2012,1557239334.2919,Leida,with ```python app/src/application.py args```
2012,1557239339.2921,Ashley,is the `__init__.py` in app/?

2012,1557239371.2929,Ashley,try adding it and running it again
2012,1557239386.2934,Leida,same result
2012,1557239391.2936,Ashley,hmmm; try removing any cache files
2012,1557239459.2942,Leida,"including in facenet?; removing from app/src left with the same result; i have a bunch of `facenet` folders around the app folder tho; like ```../facenet/facenet/facenet/src/

2012,1557239597.2973,Leida,i have a similar project in the folder outside of app folder
2012,1557239600.2974,Clemmie,you might want to rethink your naming - that is going to get (is?) really confusing
2012,1557239602.2976,Ashley,"I mean `__pycache__` folders; also, yeah"
2012,1557239616.2981,Leida,the naming is sorta wip xD; problem is i pulled a project that wraps facenet and is called facenet which has a module of facenet xD
2012,1557239670.2993,Ashley,you can use the `__init__.py` to clean that up nicely
2012,1557239713.3002,Leida,dont see any more `__pychache__` folders using find in app folder
2012,1557239756.3007,Ashley,"in the `__init__.py` in the top level of `facenet/`, you can basically control what the namespace is of the `facenet` package; so if you do `import facenet`, you don't have to do `facenet.src.facenet.thing`. You can just do `facenet.thing`; any cache folders in any of the subdirectories?"
2012,1557239888.3023,Leida,"hmm using tree i did find some chaches, ill remove em"
2016,1557239922.3025,Jung,<@Marth> :taco: thanks
2012,1557240008.3029,Leida,still same result; some problem with pyenv maybe?; im in a pyenv but the vim i run uses a different version of python for linting for example
2012,1557240125.3044,Ashley,"ah; try this; activate your venv (if it isn't already active), and run `pip freeze`; that shouldn't reveal any problems, but doesn't hurt to check"
2012,1557240237.3063,Leida,you mean to check if there are any facenets in there?
2012,1557240247.3065,Ashley,"yeah, or any other oddities"
2012,1557240296.3073,Leida,None
2012,1557240362.3084,Ashley,"hmm; so just to be clear, you basically have this going on, right?

2012,1557240456.31,Ashley,"and you're in the parent directory of `app/`, correct?"
2012,1557240473.3104,Leida,currently one up from that

2012,1557240524.3116,Ashley,ok cool; and your venv is active?
2012,1557240550.3124,Leida,pyenv but not venv
2012,1557240564.3127,Ashley,"venv is just short for virtual environment; there's a bunch of tools for managing one; but same concept; also, you're running `python app/src/application.py some args`?"
2012,1557240631.3145,Leida,"i installed a separate python version before starting to mess with the project and i set that python version in the pyenv, so i can use the same packages jumping from one project to another; some args yes; the args are paths to files outside of the project tho; didnt copy over my test data, rather gave them as inputs to my script with extra relative pathing"
2012,1557240751.3175,Ashley,"just a heads up regarding the virtual envs, they install a duplicate of the python binary you tell them, and that duplicate will point to it's own site-packages folder (so it has it's own set of packages ""installed"" there, and it doesn't utilize any pacakges from the copy of python it was duplicated from); so you don't have to go out of your way to install another copy of python yourself; it bassically does that for you; not sure if that's what you meant though; but anyway, it sounds like that should work then"
2012,1557240833.32,Leida,"ok, well i guess ill create a virtualenv for that porject, try with only the needed packages and see what happens"
2012,1557240844.3202,Ashley,worth a shot; I'll try my own little experiment to see what it does
2012,1557240901.3212,Leida,thanks alot for taking your time walking me through this <@Ashley> :taco:
2012,1557241059.3214,Ashley,"no problem; also, I can recreate it; so you're not alone; I'm guessing that because you're passing python `app/src/application.py`, it only cares about `application.py`'s immediate folder; I'm gonna try something"
2012,1557241211.3239,Leida,there was something about trying to run the file as a module somewhere on stackexchange but i didnt get far with it
2012,1557241449.3241,Ashley,"interesting; ```
$ python app/thing.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""app/thing.py"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .src import application
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '__main__.src'; '__main__' is not a package
```; ok, so it looks like I was right; because you are calling `python app/src/application.py`, your context is limited to the `app/src/` directory; basically, python doesn't care about anything above that folder, because you didn't treat the whole thing like it was a package; so now the solution; `python -m app.src.application some args`; that treats `app/src/application.py` as a module within a larger package"
2012,1557241975.3271,Holly,I actually used zlib here to decompress the messages on the fly so I could then decode them without issue :slightly_smiling_face:

2012,1557242593.3338,Ashley,"<@Leida> it's the right way for some things. I would just make sure you have that `if __name__ == '__main__':` bit in there so you can explicitly provide behavior you want when that module is called directly. Other than that, I would make sure you have the `__main__.py` module in the root with the appropriate behavior (once the time comes for you app to actually be used like one) so you can call the ""app"" directly"
2012,1557242686.3348,Leida,"thanks, i do have `__name__ ==` bit already, trying to use it for manual testing"
2012,1557242899.3352,Ashley,"it's also a good idea to consider the behavior you're testing, and try to build unit tests that validate it; that way you get the tests in at the same time that you implement the behavior"
2012,1557243063.3359,Leida,"i know its good i just have never gotten to doing it proper...; currently im supposed to build a microservice around a prebuilt model of a face detection network; i started off with trying to get to grips with tensorflow enough to even run the model properly; so now that i have something working im refactoring it into a project with web oriented layout; so i dont know exactly when or which bits i would test; like right now i test that the script works and i get a properly detected image out, this is human verifiable, but the api would just give the boxes coordinates; is there any good resource how to get the workflow right that is python oriented?"
2018,1557243811.3463,Alicia,"[sphinx]

Hi guys there is a simple way to format the methods signature in sphinx?
I am using RTD Theme, and building to html.

The problems I have at the moment are:
• custom types annotations created using typing module are being printed in their full form, but I would like just their name to be printed (ex. `CustomType = Union[type1, type2, type3]`should be rendered as simply `CustomType`, but gets rendered as `Union[type1, type2, type3]` instead)
• method signature is printed on a single line, I would like it to be printed as an indented custom form
• method signature should highlight syntax somehow like in an IDE"
2012,1557244536.3508,Ashley,"<@Leida> just make sure you treat things that are basically a tool (in this case, something that can detect faces and return a bounding box) as a separate resource. That'll make compartmentalization simpler and help you avoid things getting tightly coupled. Your microservice itself should be able to treat the face detection tool as a black box that it just passes an image (or image location) to and gets back the bounding box. This makes your code less coupled, and makes writing tests much easier; I would recommend trying to create an importable package that you can keep totally separate of your microservice's code. That way, you can install that package in the environment your microservice will use, and then it can just do `from facenet import detect_face` and then just call `bounding_box = detect_face(image_location)`"
2012,1557244795.3542,Leida,umm so i would have the detection logic in a separate repo and pull it in as a submodule to the api repo?
2012,1557244809.3548,Ashley,"I wouldn't say separate repo necessarily; you can definitely have it in the same repo; sometimes having a separate package entirely is a bit much, so I like to have a `utils` subpackage in the root package where I keep the source for those types of tools.; then I can do `from app.utils import detect_face`; it's still almost entirely separate form the app's code, and you can have your app still treat it like a black box; at that point, it's really just personal preference"
2012,1557244964.3577,Leida,well what i have is app.py to deal with the api that imports application.py that has the face detection business logic; and i have utilities folder that keeps the visualizer code that takes the image and the boxes and draws em on
2012,1557245379.3616,Holly,"yeah the starting bytes of 0x8b and 1xf were the giveaway once I really looked, then it was just a matter of taking the decompressed decoded data, doing a `literal_eval` to turn it to a dict then parsing it all out into log files was a synch!"
2012,1557245437.3632,Ashley,"I would suggest asking if you could see something being reasonably used as a standalone tool. If so, it should be in that utils subpackage; Or it's own package"
2012,1557245595.3645,Leida,hmm so my visualizer could be a method in the face detection class and the class as an utility?
2012,1557245652.365,Ashley,"Remember to keep it compartmentalized and decoupled; Detecting a face isn't related to drawing a square on an image given some coordinates; I don't know how you're visualizing it, but you don't need to detect a face to visualize some info. The info you get from the face detection process just happens to be the info you want to visualize"
2019,1557245923.3681,Holly,anyone good with pathlib?
2012,1557245927.3682,Jimmy,maybe <@Elaine> can help you with that. he often answer in <#CCC8SRJHX|documentation> about sphinx question (hopefully the ping doesn't annoys you <@Elaine> :slightly_smiling_face: )

2012,1557246084.3686,Holly,"^good point botalot; I'm trying to use pathlib to check if a file exists, if it doesn't create it with the following try except block:

This is something I've been meaning to look into, I don't like it either (output gets confusing to read when the type hints are more complicated). I will try and remember to look tonight, if you are using autodoc what I'm going to try is this `<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#event-autodoc-process-signature>` when `what` is `""function""`

&gt; method signature is printed on a single line

This may or may not be possible, I'm not sure.

&gt; method signature should highlight syntax

Hmm. This may be possible if we can figure out how to get access to emitting changes to the function signature (the same place, wherever it is, that doing single line to custom indented takes place). You can use pygments (same thing that is used to show code in the docs with `.. code-block::`).

I'll take a look later tonight and see if I can figure out more info. These are things I would want to do too :slightly_smiling_face: feel free to ping me if I forget..."

2025,1557268343.4257,Maricruz,You need to loop through the row you want your headers in; right now you're just assigning the value to `cellref` over and over again

2025,1557273462.4394,Sasha,`enumerate()` can take a `start=1` parameter if you don't want it to begin from 0.

2025,1557273618.4413,Sasha,"BTW, from a stylistic perspective, I'd recommend avoiding the `*k` pattern you have there. It's correct, but it will throw people off versus explicit `i, ser` variables.; If you wanted to skip the first element instead, you can use `serials[1:]`."
2025,1557273730.4428,Priscilla,i  wanted `start=1` but i was looking at `serials[1:]` for my solution; by mistake; good point on the *k

2028,1557286234.495,Sasha,BTW it's good practice to put a `time.sleep()` call in such loops to avoid burning 100% CPU. Even sleeping for a millisecond often makes a big difference.

Does anyone think I might get faster performance if I put the dataframes into a SQLite database instead?   I’ve not been able to find much info on the relative speed of unpickling Vs SQLlite.

2042,1557382417.0411,Chester,I like the one-liner approach (you can unfold it to multiple lines) because it builds a new list instead of mutating an existing one; This actually makes it easier to pass any iterable instead of strictly list

In my project, which you can think of as a SaaS, when you create a Company(sort of), this company has to subscribe by making payment to _my_ company. This subscription could be for a month, a quarter/half of a year, or it cover a whole year. When the company's subscription is active, all routes in _my_ company's API would be accessible but immediately the subscription expires, none of the routes become accessible. It sends you a *subscription ended* RESTful result.

Now, there's a model `Company` that has several columns, one of each is `subscriptions` which is *supposed* to hold all the subscriptions that a company has made including the expired subscriptions and the current active one. 

```
class Company (db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'companies'
    subscriptions = db.relationship('Subscription', backref='company', lazy='dynamic')
   # followed by several other columns

class Subscription (db.Model):
# stuffs

```

Now my question is, how do you think I can implement the subscription 'model' such that when I add a `@active_subscription_on` decorator on a route, this decorator checks the current user's company's subscription to see if their subscription is active?

How can I implement the subscription system?; Here's what I've thought of(although I haven't implemented it): when your company _clicks_ on buy subscription(to generate a key, think Windows OS serial key), for a month, I use `itsdangerous`'s `TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer` to encode the duration of the subscription, then use `base64` on the result for something readable. That gives me the key to give to the company and when entered to extend their subscription days, I simply reverse the process to get the duration the subscription will cover. I can then add this period to the company's list of subscriptions. 

Now, I don't really know how to make the decorator gain access to this information and be quick with it!"
2061,1557481453.1753,Bee,"Hi there, I have a similar setup where I check if a user’s role is permitted for a particular route. I have a custom `login_required()` function which is used as a decorator for each of my routes.

The function is:
```
def login_required(role=""ANY""):
    def wrapper(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def decorated_view(*args, **kwargs):
            if not current_user.is_authenticated:
                return current_app.login_manager.unauthorized()

            if role not in [current_user.role, ""ANY""]:
                return current_app.login_manager.unauthorized()   
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_view
    return wrapper
```

and it is used as a decorator like this:
```
@app.route('/admin')
@login_required('super_admin')
def admin_page():
    return
```

I would suggest to make a similar decorator function that checks the subscription of the ‘current’ company - hope that helps"

2066,1557503007.2105,Avis,or should i learn to work with objects directly instead of finding the easy way out
2066,1557503012.2107,Clemmie,^; asking to represent an object as a list is nonsensical
2066,1557503083.2118,Avis,so I might have some concepts mixed up
2066,1557503145.2129,Clemmie,probably - an object (lets say class) is made up of function and attributes `x=2` etc. How would you expect that to show up as a list?

All resources in REST are entities. They can be independent like:
GET /users - get all users
GET /users/123 - get a particular user with id = 123
GET /posts - get all posts
There are also dependent entities, that rely on their parent models:
GET /users/123/projects - get all the projects that a user with id = 123 has

2067,1557505105.2187,Raguel,"or like if they are related resources, one handler with if statements, parsing endpoints?; `os.path.splitext` might be helpful"
2067,1557505198.2192,Hiroko,"more like, one thing parsing the URL and packaging it into params for your handler; a mapper would map your URL definition to a handler"
2067,1557505238.2196,Rodrick,How would I use that in that scenario
2067,1557505267.2198,Hiroko,"so one handler per endpoint that would handle the HTTP verb required (get, put, post, delete, etc)"
2067,1557505333.22,Raguel,do you have sample file names?

2067,1557505567.2218,Hiroko,"correct.  because one would be a List in the response and the other woould be a Detail; you can share logic between them, but they have different responsibilities"

2072,1557519438.257,Tyson,"I'm looking for an elegant way to use some LRUCache, e.g. from cachetools, with multi-keys."
2071,1557519461.2575,Tyson,"(multiple keys pointing to the same, cached object)"
2072,1557519483.258,Tyson,Any ideas where to start?
2072,1557519540.2588,Clemmie,I think you would want a wrapper that mapped the multi-keys to a single shared key before hitting the LRUChache decorated object
2072,1557519654.2593,Tyson,"hmm... that would be possible if I'd knew all possible keys in advance; e.g. just hash them all together; the flow is like that: a user requests a object by key. if the object exists in the cache, it's returned; another user reuqests the object but using a different key (e.g. a different, unique property); the object is already in cache"
2072,1557519807.2631,Clemmie,"the trouble is that LRUCache maps the function call to the return value, so if you have a different function call (different key in param) it will be different - even keyword order on calling can be a different entry `f(a=1, b=2)` might not hit the cache of `f(b=2, a=1)`"
2072,1557519818.2634,Holly,What if you load the file into the script make the changes and just rewrite that way the order and formatting are retained?
2072,1557519837.2641,Tyson,"so, after I found the matching object I'd like to add the second key so it can be found if the next user requests the object using one of the two keys we know so far"
2072,1557519881.2647,Clemmie,"is there a computation taking place, or just a lookup?"
2072,1557519891.2651,Tyson,lookup; and some read io
2072,1557519900.2656,Clemmie,LRUCache is really for computation heavy functions. It won’t give you anything for lookups
2072,1557519933.2663,Tyson,I just wanted to dump all stuff into memory so I don't have to read from disk for every request; thought a simply dict would do it; I want to limit it's size; LRU seems like a nice strategy; also: concurrent access could be an issue
2072,1557519989.2683,Clemmie,"sure, you can build a cache to do it, and mimic the functionality of LRUCache, but you will need to build you own tooling"
2072,1557520033.2691,Tyson,"I see. okay, good to know. So at least I know LRUCache will most probably be a dead end"

What am i doing wrong?"
2074,1557541113.2767,Sasha,"Your `report()` function would want to store the output in `self.output_csv`. If it's just a function-local variable, it disappears when the function exits."
2074,1557541196.2777,Priscilla,"yeah it is a local variable and i do need it to disappear, looks like i need a workaround."
2074,1557541215.2782,Sasha,"Can you clarify why you need it to disappear?; Looks like you need it to remain around for a while, to write it."
2074,1557541393.2803,Priscilla,"so i updated it with the timed loop I need the for loop to run within. there is another loop inside of the function `report()` I need to write it after the time loops finish, so I took the write statment out of the `report()` function.; here is the function"
2074,1557541547.282,Sasha,"Do you need the output to be a combination of all of the output from the different serials, and write it when all of them are done?"
2074,1557541582.2822,Priscilla,yes
2074,1557541760.2851,Sasha,"Okay, in that case you need to have `output_csv` be a variable in your top-level code, and have each device return their part to be appended. For instance, in `report()` you would have `return output_str, output_csv`, and in the outer loop you'd have something like:
```output_csv = ''
for s in serials:
  device = BurnIn(s, usr)
  output, csv = device.report()
  print(output)
  output_csv += csv
with open('csvfile.csv', 'a') as f:
  f.write(output_csv)```; However, I might reconsider the requirement to write the output at the very end. With append mode, you can write as you go, and it might suck to lose all your data if the program crashes before it finishes."
2074,1557542075.2884,Priscilla,"ok, now that was one of my first plans. the problem is that `report()` does not return `output` it returns a similar string with spaces in it to display a kind of ""table"" so its not really comma seperated.; and i will take your advice on appending, instead of writting.; because it prints out the statuse every minute, but only appends to the csv after the full 24 hours have finished"
2074,1557542327.2904,Sasha,"That's why I said you should `return output_str, output_csv` in `report()`, to get access to both the printable text and the CSV data."
2074,1557542791.2919,Priscilla,"how neat, how does it know to assign to `output` and `csv` respectively?; oh,
`output, csv = ...`
and
`return output, csv`
i guess"
2074,1557542886.2933,Sasha,"Yep. It's actually returning a 2-element tuple, and unpacking it when you assign the return value to 2 variables."
2074,1557543106.2939,Priscilla,very cool
2074,1557543224.2947,Hsiu,"That’s why a stray comma can make your code behave in unexpected ways. `x = 1,` means `x = (1, )` (a tuple, not an int)"
2074,1557544736.295,Priscilla,"that makes a lot of sense; for some reason this

2075,1557547960.2994,Sasha,"<@Alishia> Usually that would mean re-scaling numbers to a common range, so that you don't have one feature which is 9,000,000,000 and another one which is 0.0000002 trying to be mixed together.; The guys in <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> may be able to give you some more details."

2086,1557645287.3391,Valeri,"Hi people!
Need help.
So, I've got this new task of building an ML based chatbot for a law based firm.
I have no clue about how ML and chatbots work.
Where do I begin?
I need a definitive roadmap"
2087,1557648449.3393,Scot,Link to the assignment:- <https://qezyqctqbsczfkpoxmxvur.coursera-apps.org/notebooks/IdentifyingSpecialMatrices.ipynb>; <#C07EFMZ1N|help> can someone help me to understand how we are setting the sub-diagonal elements to zero?
2088,1557649450.3406,Neely,"Hey waqas, it depends on what you want the chatbot to do. The most common use case is implementing natural language processing (NLP) to an utterance/text message to identify a discrete “intent” e.g. “Hey Siri, what’s the time?” may map to an intent called “lookup-time”. These intents are effectively conversational states, and you can design and control the flow of conversation programmatically by managing these states. I recommend trying out Google’s Dialogflow (<https://dialogflow.com/>) in order to get a better understanding. The good thing about Dialogflow is that the machine learning model is provided for you so that you can just focus on designing the conversational flow. However, if you’re planning to self-learn ML and chatbots from the ground up I can supply you with a learning roadmap :slightly_smiling_face:"
2087,1557652324.3413,Valeri,"<@Scot> I don't understand how `A[1,0]` could actually refer to something"
2086,1557652340.3417,Valeri,Can you show us what `A` looks like?
2087,1557652417.3418,Valeri,"<@Neely> I really appreciate your help; Let's say I have 3-4 months to accomplish this; Is that reasonable timeline considering that I'm willing to devote 2-3 hours daily to this?; Also, I would definitely like to go via the basic roadmap and later on figure out if I should use google's libraries; What say? <@Neely>"
2089,1557654179.3443,Neely,"It really depends on how you want the chatbot to perform, and whether the 3-4 month timeline covers just the MVP and/or if you’ll be doing continued maintenance on the chatbot beyond that. Have a thorough chat with your client to make sure your expectations align. It also depends how involved you’ll be across the stack e.g. Will you be developing a frontend, backend and chatbot server? Or just an API endpoint for your client to query?"
2090,1557655542.3445,Scot,A is actually a 4x4 matrix.I however solved the assignment.Thanks anyway.
2087,1557656456.3447,Valeri,Just the APIs; I don't do frontend
2091,1557663125.3466,Pura,"If i have around 1 million ids and i need to pass each one to to a http get request and save the result in a db, how could i do this efficiently?"
2091,1557663371.3472,Hiroko,are you hitting the same API with these IDs?; do the API terms of service allow you to store the results locally?
2091,1557663531.3477,Pura,yes same api. the service does allow me to store the result; Im jusyt unsure if this is a usecase for multiprocessing; or something else like asyncio/aiohttp
2091,1557663564.3483,Hiroko,"both, actually"
2091,1557663578.3485,Pura,The issue im having with multiprocessing is sharing and synchronising state; because the API has terms of rate_limiting and to get around this i create multiple API Accounts and need to switch between them when i hit the limit
2091,1557663633.3489,Hiroko,"well, lower your requirements to fit the terms of service?"
2091,1557663647.3491,Pura,so i need to synchronise between processes which app it should do and when it should sleep when all accounts hit the limit
2091,1557663664.3493,Hiroko,since apparently you’re trying to do a workaround behind the terms of the API service if you’re discussing using multiple accounts
2091,1557663705.3495,Pura,yes but they allow for multiple accounts and because i have a large amount of data trying to process all the data using one account would take too long
2091,1557663712.3497,Hiroko,":thumbsup:; if you don’t have asyncio in your project, check out requests futures"
2091,1557663755.3501,Pura,"so im wondering could i achieve the same goal of processing the data using asyncio, instead of multiprocessing"
2091,1557663757.3503,Hiroko,<https://github.com/ross/requests-futures>
2091,1557663776.3506,Pura,"because i think using async http requests instead would allow me to keep track of the accounts and their rate limit, easier than trying to sync data using mp; and which method would be more efficient; my main problem with mp is communicating between processes which apps are available."
2092,1557669284.3516,Bethany,"If you're expected to make a chatbot by yourself in this time frame with no experience you really should see if you can make it work with a pre canned solution, like google dialogflow as suggested above. I'm curious how you would get in this situation?"
2091,1557671659.3519,Valeri,"I've done a bit of data analytics in the past. So, they came to me and asked me to help them out and I wish to take up this challenge. "

2095,1557687480.36,Sasha,"As pasted, the code has some messed-up indents (misalignment between `if` and `else`). Is the original different?; I'm a little suspicious that you have the `sleep()` before the write, instead of between the write and the read."
2095,1557687765.3633,Priscilla,"that was not my intention, but it did not fix the issue when placed correctly, in beteeen the write and read but thank you for pointing that out, also those indents come from the formatter, I took them out and were also not the culprit because i thought that too"
2095,1557687784.3638,Chester,I suppose `read_until` blocks until the specified byte string is in the buffer; Not sure why you check for its presence later.  It will always be true
2095,1557687838.3654,Sasha,"I'm guessing that `read_until()` might not block, but just doesn't consume any text after the target string."
2095,1557687896.3664,Priscilla,i guess i could put that `read_until()` in its own if statments right? or remove the if statements and use only try and except
2095,1557687934.3673,Sasha,The obvious next debugging step is to print out `read_ser_menu` to see what it's getting back.
2095,1557687938.3674,Priscilla,"<@Sasha> that string is the only thing it needs to read; i know what its gettting back from a terminal monitor called docklight, i am sending the same commands there and viewing real time output. do you think that there could be a difference between the programs?; im tring it anywho"
2095,1557688143.3704,Sasha,"A good general principle when you're debugging a problem that shouldn't be happening is to say, ""Okay, this IS happening, therefore one of my assumptions about what's going on is wrong. How can I test my assumptions?"" In this case, you are assuming that what you see in the terminal is what the Python code is seeing. Test that."
2095,1557688188.3708,Priscilla,"good point, on it"
2095,1557688470.3715,Sasha,What exception?
2095,1557688612.372,Priscilla,"i fixed it, formatting was bad; and i couldnt find a list of the exceptions, only 2 examples, so i defined my own"
2095,1557688656.3734,Sasha,(This is one reason why people discourage catch-all `except` clauses. They catch even syntax errors.)
2095,1557688672.3736,Priscilla,oh; how do i find the list of exceptions I can call? should be in the docs right?
2095,1557688912.3748,Sasha,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html>
2095,1557688916.3749,Karoline,"It's in the docs, but the general idea is, find out what exception you are expecting, and catch that.; And if you have to for some reason cast a wide net like this, make sure you are logging the exception you caught; because it's easy to make assumptions about why you think you got there, but best to know for sure"
2095,1557689358.3771,Priscilla,ok i think i understand; oh yeah that really helped. have more understandable error output
2096,1557690394.3788,Priscilla,"weird, its reading 2 blank lines; None"
2096,1557690799.38,Sasha,Are you hitting a timeout? What's the port timeout set to?; Note that the `SerialTimeoutException` will only be raised on writes. Read timeouts just return less data than expected.
2096,1557691119.3819,Caridad,"whats the best way to schedule running a `scrapy` spider to scrape a website at specific intervals. Do most people just use cron, or is there another library to do this"
2096,1557691163.3826,Karoline,cron works.  alternatively I've used stuff like Azure's Data Factory in the past as well.
2097,1557691259.3834,Caridad,ill check out azure thanks <@Karoline> :taco:
2096,1557691646.3841,Karoline,It might be a bit overkill if all you really need is to scrape at specific intervals. ; We used it as part of a much larger data pipeline. 
2098,1557699995.3853,Priscilla,"how come this loop is indefinite and not stopping after 2?

2098,1557703798.387,Priscilla,"line 3, is that corrupted data?"
2099,1557704058.3877,Sasha,Depends on the protocol... do you expect anything non-ASCII?
2098,1557704088.3882,Priscilla,"should be, and i am decoding to utf-8; sometimes it comes back correct; like 5 minutes ago it was correct everytime, then started to fluctuate. now its just always that gobbltygook"
2098,1557704354.3899,Sasha,I'd suspect a RS232 baud rate mismatch.
2098,1557704525.3901,Priscilla,"hmmm; omg, it is reading the commands all wrong, thats what it is i send it something and sometimes it thinks E is the command E but sometimes its the command A... wtf!"
2098,1557704996.3921,Sasha,"They are only 1 bit off, so in theory line noise might cause that, but it's a little specific of an error. Do you have an ""A"" test elsewhere in your code that might be running?"
2098,1557705307.3937,Priscilla,it doesnt run more than one test at a time
2098,1557705366.3944,Sasha,"Well, I'm wondering if you might have other data queued up in the read buffer from previous tests, or something like that."
2098,1557705440.3954,Priscilla,"that was my thought, trying to place `port.flushInput()`and `port.flushInput()` in the correct place; i think just before it writes; so i figured out that its now printing the characters that come before the expected output. which actually is that mess of data.; i just dont know why its printing that out now"
2098,1557707255.3973,Sasha,Couldn't say. There's `port.in_waiting` if you want to check the number of bytes queued in the read buffer.
2098,1557713270.3978,Priscilla,this device is just not working as they said it would :triumph:
2100,1557715694.3988,Sasha,"Is it a commercial device where you'd expect it to behave reliably and have public documentation, or a custom gizmo that's still in beta?"
2098,1557721719.4,Priscilla,Custom. Most of it is reverse engineered over the decades. In a long chain of engineers. ; very little documentation for sure.

Then try out another alternative called Rasa (<https://rasa.com/>) which is open source and more flexible. If you really want to get familiar with the underlying ML concepts driving these chatbots from scratch, I suggest auditing one of the many free online courses on either Udacity, Coursera or YouTube. The main concepts around ML I think you should focus on are “supervised learning”, “recurrent neural networks”, “word embeddings”, and “reinforcement learning”. If you have a decent grasp of probability, statistics and differential calculus then you should be able to get stuck into it right away. I also suggest taking a cursory look at “speech act theory” to give you an idea of how people generally structure chatbot conversations."

2107,1557754847.4212,Claudine,"your `\b+` just finds multiple word breaks; your `[^$]` finds anthing NOT a $; you want `\$` to match a $ char, else `$` on it's own matches EOL"

2108,1557756540.4327,Avis,Hey is there a way to exclude elements in a list when running a for loop ?
2108,1557756680.4331,Karoline,you can have a list comprehension be where your iterable is
2108,1557756704.4339,Holly,"that or a conditional, if the element == X pass"
2108,1557756704.434,Karoline,`for thing in [t for t in things if t is not None]:` for example
2108,1557756722.4346,Holly,list comprehension is the smaller way :slightly_smiling_face:
2108,1557756748.4352,Cindy,"it may be smaller, but has overhead incurred.; Since you're already iterating, can't you just add a condition to `continue` if you found a criteria for exclusion?"
2108,1557756770.4357,Karoline,"it's unfortunate that you can't just use the syntax directly in the for loop, but oh well"
2108,1557756851.4368,Clemmie,Will it work with the walrus operator in 3.8? Seems like it maybe would
2108,1557756857.4371,Holly,"what is the overhead on list comprehensions like?  I honestly never use them because I haven't spent enough time really learning them and they hurt my brain, so I do them the long way"
2108,1557756885.4382,Clemmie,"not a ton, but you are recreating the list that you already have and are iterating through, so it is overhead you don’t need at all"
2108,1557756893.4388,Cindy,"<@Holly> you're filtering ahead eagerly, then going through the result again."
2108,1557756923.4394,Avis,cool thanks all  I'll give it a try basically I have list 1 and list 2 and I need to exclude all the elements that are common in both
2108,1557756947.4403,Hiroko,"<@Cindy> actually, its one filter operation per loop block"
2108,1557756953.4406,Avis,and run the for loop on the rest
2108,1557756984.4417,Clemmie,ah - you should use set logic (assuming it is ok to remove duplicates)
2108,1557756985.4418,Hiroko,I would be very surprised if the loop results in executing the filter op each time
2108,1557757007.4423,Cindy,"yes i meant once, but eagerly, up front."
2108,1557757030.4429,Karoline,"certainly worth being aware of, but probably not a concern for most people"
2108,1557758138.444,Claudine,never heard it called the walrus

foo = Storage()
```"
2109,1557758381.4471,Rodrick,Thats it?
2109,1557758385.4475,Holly,`storage.Storage`
2109,1557758385.4476,Hiroko,:yep:
2109,1557758389.4479,Rodrick,Wow
2109,1557758394.4483,Claudine,well then `foo` would be an instance of storage yep
2109,1557758400.4488,Holly,as long as they're in the same folder its that simple yep
2109,1557758404.449,Rodrick,I thought it would be harder than that; Wow thanks guys
2109,1557758417.4501,Claudine,:thumbsup:
2109,1557758463.4511,Hiroko,"if its in another place, you’d do `from some_top_level_package.some_inner_packagage.storage import Storage`"
2109,1557758470.4513,Rodrick,ahhh ok
2109,1557758590.4517,Claudine,"or add that folder to your system path, but i think that's not the best practice"
2109,1557758628.4519,Rodrick,Yea; Any help would be nice
2110,1557760930.4537,Clemmie,"please show the code that is calling this - It looks ike you are calling it from the class level, and it is expecting a class instance"
2109,1557761009.4543,Rodrick,None
2109,1557761394.4552,Clemmie,"yeah, you need an instance of keywords, or make analyze a class method (likely the first).; None"
2109,1557761425.4558,Rodrick,Ok I will try that; `__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'keyword'` Getting this now; Code is the same
2109,1557761555.4573,Clemmie,"ah, yes, when you initialize `Keyword()` it looks like it wants a keyword to set to `self.keyword` sorry i missed that"
2109,1557761655.458,Rodrick,So do I need to re-initilize a `self.Keyword`?
2109,1557761676.4586,Clemmie,lets take a step back - what are you trying to do with this class?
2109,1557761730.4595,Rodrick,"I needs to read in a string, process it and return either true or false"
2109,1557761758.4601,Clemmie,"ok, what does “process it” mean, and what is `self.keywrod` supposed to hold?"
2109,1557761849.4613,Rodrick,processing the string is basically checking to see if it has certain attributes and then based on the conditions it will return true or false; `self.keyword` is holding the keyword. And I am new to classes so this may seem like a dumb question but if I am only defining the `analyze` def in the class do i need the `self.keyword = keyword`; in the `__init__`
2109,1557761962.4637,Clemmie,is the keyword the condition you are searching for in a given string?
2109,1557762004.4643,Rodrick,Ahhhh I see one moment that code is confusing let me fix it one moment
2109,1557762019.4646,Clemmie,"hold on…; Lets talk it through first; you might not need a class, it might be simpler (or harder)"
2109,1557762050.4655,Rodrick,Ok
2109,1557762073.4667,Eliana,it can be useful to leave out the implementation details and mainly discuss the problem.
2109,1557762080.4669,Clemmie,conceptually what are you thinking `self.keyword` will represent?
2109,1557762087.4671,Rodrick,well I am using a class because I want the keywords function in another program
2109,1557762096.4674,Clemmie,you can import functions too; everything in python is an object and can be imported
2109,1557762159.4684,Holly,`from Keywords import analyze`
2109,1557762171.4687,Rodrick,"It will represent a string where the keywords will be taken out; so if my string is `Hello how are you`; It will cut it up into `hello`, `how`, `are`, `you`; Hold up; Oh i fixed it; yay; so i removed the `self.keyword` funtion which was giving me the error"
2109,1557762334.4717,Clemmie,it did look superfluous
2109,1557762339.472,Rodrick,yea
2109,1557762343.4722,Clemmie,but now you don’t need the  calss; `analyze` (or more preferably  `does_string_meet_conditions`) can be a standalone function
2109,1557762433.474,Rodrick,Yea now I get what you are saying

2112,1557781251.4984,Walton,I need to account for the O'Malleys; as before it was for the De Los Santos; this time i'm protecting the code against the irish; So Timothy O'Malley for a proposed UID should be omallet
2112,1557781413.0006,Clemmie,"yeah, you need to check if all chars are alpha - you _do_ want what I was showing earlier - `"""".join([x for x in text if x.isalpha()])`; you probably also want to set you entire uid to lower, so `uid= &lt;get uid logic&gt;.lower()`"
2112,1557781659.0024,Walton,"so in your example, what would the 2nd x be? as that'd be a variable; i just confused myself"
2113,1557781705.0035,Walton,"what is x, is an easier question"
2112,1557781742.0041,Walton,"What I am doing right now , using OpenPyxl"
2112,1557781806.0055,Clemmie,"that is a list comprehension - it is making a list of characters `x` with the for loop `x in text` (strings are iterable) and it tests if each `x.isalpha()` before it adds it to the list. This gives you a list of chars that are then `join`ed with the character `""""` as the joining string"
2112,1557781997.0058,Walton,gotcha. so my final string should look like
2112,1557782050.0062,Clemmie,close; this assumes you are using python 3.6+. If you are under 3.6 replace the f string with the correct string formatting for your version
2112,1557782254.0072,Walton,"oh, thats completely different from my 2nd answer :stuck_out_tongue:"
2112,1557782279.0075,Clemmie,"there are also superfluous paren in mine, one sec"
2112,1557782279.0076,Walton,None; yours makes much more sense
2112,1557782343.0087,Clemmie,"it might take some tweaking - I copy/paste, didn’t read it too closely, but you get the gist I think. gotta run - good luck!"
2112,1557782362.0089,Walton,Thanks so much!
2114,1557786930.0128,Ashely,"hey all.  I'm stumbling my way through writing a script to alert me when an item comes back in stock, using beautifulsoup. I'm stuck on a problem diving down into elements in the page.
If I print the output of:
```results = soup.find_all(""div"", class_=""inventory_holder"")```
I get the div element that contains the span element I'm after.  But that span element isn't in the output.; For reference, here's the code as I see it in the browser:; So I'm trying to get my hands on that span element called 'cta_price'.; Any suggestions as to why bs4 isn't pulling that from the div?; (edited code above, searching divs not spans)"
2114,1557788187.0162,Sasha,I wonder if the bs4 parser is getting confused by the quotes-within-quotes used in that tag. Does the tag output include those correctly?

2114,1557788699.0173,Sasha,"Cool, looks like it's transforming the quotes correctly.; Is there any chance that the `span` content you want is being dynamically inserted by Javascript in the browser and isn't actually in the HTML you're feeding to bs4?"
2115,1557792459.0183,Karol,guys where is the error:
2115,1557792859.0209,Sasha,That's peculiar. Any chance you have a `pandas.py` file in your directory that might be masking the real Pandas library? Can you `print(pd.read_csv)` to see what Python thinks that is?
2116,1557792983.0227,Hai,"Hello, Guys is there any way can a python script work as a listener for receiving the emails? basically, i want to filter the emails and trigger a Jenkins job. but first, I want to configure a listener which actually receives the emails and filters ? is it possible?"
2115,1557793399.0228,Karol,"prints the route of the file , this is very weird I'm using collaboratory"
2115,1557793654.023,Sasha,Any chance that it's remembering something from a previous session where you accidentally typed `pd.read_csv = ...`?
2115,1557793774.0232,Karol,no chance I closed and reopen it
2115,1557793958.0234,Sasha,"I'm out of ideas, I'm afraid, beyond ""Collaboratory is weirdly broken"".  :sweat:"
2115,1557794033.0236,Karol,hahaha yeah it sucks I create a new book from scratch and it worked damn it
2115,1557794081.0238,Sasha,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2115,1557795305.0251,Ashely,"<@Sasha> Sorry, broke for dinner.  I'm a little embarassed to say I have no idea, or how to find out.  I'll dig into it.  If it is dynamically generated, any suggestion for how you'd pull it in to a script?"
2115,1557795594.026,Sasha,"One way to test is to turn off Javascript in your browser and see what the page source looks like in that case. You can also try printing out the data that you're giving to bs4.; If it is dynamically generated, you're in more <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> territory, and might need to use something like Selenium to behave more like a browser."
2115,1557795943.028,Ashely,"Yep, sure enough.  The 'out of stock' button the span element sits on top of doesn't even load.  Good call.; I'll take my case to the scrapers.  Thanks for the point in the right direction."

2119,1557832925.0418,Pura,"i am using `asyncio.ensure_future` to run multiples tasks.

In the task, under a certain condition i need everything (all tasks) to sleep and wait for 15 minutes. so i use `time.sleep(900)`

however i get the following timeout error after 20-30 minutes.
```concurrent.futures._base.TimeoutError```

Why is it timing out and not waking after 900s"
2119,1557832984.0424,Chester,"If you need to sleep in asyncio-based apps, you should use `asyncio.sleep` instead; Also, shameless plug: <https://github.com/malinoff/aionursery>"
2120,1557836503.0434,Pura,What if i needed the entire process to sleep because i need to wait until some rate limit has reset.
2120,1557836518.0436,Chester,"Uhm, why?"
2120,1557836533.0439,Pura,I need to wait until the rate limit has reset before continuing with the tasks; so i set a sleep to try and do this
2120,1557836594.0448,Chester,"You still want the event loop to roll. With `time.sleep` you essentially block everything from running, including various IO readiness checks, which is really really bad. You don't want to do this in asyncio-based application"
2120,1557836675.045,Pura,Okay; but if i need to have some feature to wait for 15 minutes before continuning running of the tasks/co-routines how could i do this; pause all tasks for 15 minutes depending on some condition
2121,1557837545.0458,Tatum,Backups: How are you guys implementing backups on your production sites? I'm using a postgres database.
2120,1557837556.046,Chester,RDS; It's kind of weird requirement. What if one of the tasks is in the middle of DB transaction?
2121,1557837683.0466,Karoline,"if you are on AWS, use RDS."
2120,1557837694.0469,Pura,ye true
2120,1557837701.0472,Tatum,I'm currently on GCS.
2120,1557837702.0473,Pura,there must be a better way to seperate this code then
2120,1557837730.0478,Chester,GCS? Google cloud?
2120,1557837732.0479,Karoline,I imagine they have a similar managed DB service.
2120,1557837764.0491,Tatum,Yup. I'll take a poke around. It may be worth migrating to AWS as you can't take chances with backing up data. Thanks!
2121,1557837778.0494,Karoline,"set up a DB, import a dump from your current database, do some stuff, then restore from backup so you are comfortable with the process and how it works."
2120,1557837780.0495,Pura,because i need someway to pause these operations because my app is rate limited
2120,1557837795.0501,Tatum,"Yes, Google Cloud Services"
2120,1557837823.0507,Chester,I'd say you don't need to pause operations. You need to stop scheduling operations when you face a rate limiting action.
2120,1557837825.0509,Karoline,"at this point with RDS we're comfortable enough with the restore process that we actually use it for troubleshooting as well - we'll replicate prod for really hard to reproduce issues and test against that, it's stupid easy."
2120,1557837883.0516,Chester,"RDS is also nice because it's your lovely postgres under the hood. There is no vendor lock-in, really.
You can just `pg_dump` your whole data any time, and migrate somewhere else"
2120,1557837896.0519,Pura,hmm interesting what if the operation youre currently on faced a rate limit action and you need to repeat it?
2120,1557837932.0531,Karoline,We also had to increase the size of our prod database and it was as easy as editing the size of of disk allocated to it.  It's an incredible product really.
2120,1557837946.0535,Chester,Put it in a waiting queue; replay the queue when it's possible
2121,1557837956.0542,Hiroko,"<@Tatum> FWIW, my company’s on GCP/GKE and not sure how the ops team set it up, but there’s definitely lots of backing up going on with the dbs"
2120,1557837970.0546,Chester,I wish all aws products were like RDS...
2120,1557837976.0549,Hiroko,so I doubt you need to go from GC to AWS just for this thing
2120,1557837987.0552,Karoline,"haha yeah it definitely stands out as one of their best designed.  not everything is so nice for sure; yeah my guess is there's something similar on google, it's pretty fundamental"
2120,1557838017.0563,Pura,"At the moment i scheduled operations in batches like this

```
   for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
            tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch_user_objects(apps, session, user_id=users, tweet_mode=""extended"")) for users in batch]
            for t in tasks:
                d = await t
```

Do you recommend another method? i batch request 10 at a time otherwise the process is so slow"
2120,1557838059.0574,Tatum,Thanks guys! Much appreciated. I found GCS has had to list their matching services with AWS. <https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-aws-google-cloud-platform>
2120,1557838129.0579,Karoline,"awesome, I'd be curious to hear your experience after you play with it for a bit.; also, don't forget, you don't really have a backup until you've restored from it.  so make sure you test out your restore process."
2120,1557838315.0603,Tatum,So true. I recently tried a backup script and couldn't restore it. :scream_cat: Luckily it was all fake data I inserted in a development environment
2120,1557838335.0604,Chester,I guess `asyncio.gather` would be easier
2120,1557838377.061,Pura,i mean how would you implement the “stop scheduling if the fetch_user_object” hit a rate limit action
2120,1557838413.0616,Chester,"People can be in three groups:
• ones who don't make backups yet
• ones who do
• ones who test restoration procedure"
2120,1557838413.0617,Pura,"ah the problem is that rate limit action might be for 1 app, but i need to stop scheduling if all the apps hit the rate limit"
2120,1557838422.0621,Karoline,"haha yes.; oh, and people who think RAID is backup.  lol"
2120,1557838476.0626,Pura,"the `fetch_user_objects` takes in `apps` as a parameter so i could check to see if all apps are rate limited in this function by adding some flag and if they are return some error response.

i would have to make apps a global variable so that the state is persisted?"
2120,1557838477.0628,Chester,"&gt; how would you implement the “stop scheduling if the fetch_user_object” hit a rate limit action
Just put a `await asyncio.sleep()` right before your `asyncio.ensure_future` calls.; I guess they fall into the first group :slightly_smiling_face:"
2120,1557838510.0634,Pura,i only sleep based on some condition that would be sleeping before everything?
2120,1557838639.0639,Chester,"Sure, you need to do a conditional sleep. Is that a problem? :slightly_smiling_face:"
2120,1557838669.0641,Pura,yes because i need to return a response from one of these ensure futures first
2120,1557838684.0643,Chester,"```
    for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
        if rate_limited():
            await asyncio.sleep(some_time)
        tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch_user_objects(apps, session, user_id=users, tweet_mode=""extended"")) for users in batch]
        for t in tasks:
            d = await t
```"
2120,1557838738.0649,Pura,"and this rate_limited() function could loop through all the apps and check if the flag self.rate_limit = True; this self.rate_limit = True is set within `fetch_user_objects` if it hits a 429 error from the http request; the last problem i think i see here is… this ensure_future is batch of 10 requests. If in the 5th request everything is rate limited, i would need to sleep…"
2120,1557838993.0691,Chester,"Alright, so this is a problem only if the remaining tasks haven't made rate-limited requests yet. Because if they already made requests, then they weren't really rate limited, right? Otherwise the remaining tasks will fail with some exception like `HttpTooManyRequests` - which is fine, because you can re-schedule failed tasks to the next batch"
2122,1557839001.0693,Linnea,Hello guys I have a small problem. I am having a github repository that I want to restrict people from pushing to it so that they then use PRs. I thought it was five minutes thing but I’m failing. Is the options to enable restrictions a paid feature or what?!
2120,1557839042.0694,Chester,"But if the remaining tasks have made their requests, and they were not rate limited, then you don't care about them - they are free to go and save data to a db. You don't need to do anything with them, just let them finish"
2122,1557839071.0697,Chester,Are you talking about a private repo?
2122,1557839168.0703,Linnea,No even a public repo

2120,1557839330.0719,Chester,"By default, nobody can push to your repository except for you.; You can add collaborators with different permissions (basically, ""write"" and ""admin""); So if you don't add anyone to your repo - you're good, others can only try to push their code through PRs"
2122,1557839735.0749,Linnea,Ooh the repo is having 4 collaborators and I want them to not be able to push but just submit PR
2120,1557839745.075,Pura,"yes, how do you reccomend rescheduling failed tasks.

`d = await t`

should i check the response of `d` and then retry based on that response and is there already a way to retry easily using asyncio?"
2120,1557839831.0753,Chester,"&gt; should i check the response of `d` and then retry based on that response
Yep. If there's an exception, you'll need `try`/`except` over `d = await t`"
2120,1557839896.0765,Linnea,It seems they all have push access by default. There is no place to change permissions for collaborators
2122,1557839905.0768,Chester,Why do you have them as collaborators?
2120,1557839941.0769,Pura,"ahh okay, ye there is no exception in my fetch_user_objects i have

```
if response['status'] != 200:
        app.rate_limited = True
        return {'errors': 'failed job'}
```

so i could look for `d['errors']` or maybe return some status"
2122,1557839996.0777,Karoline,just make master a protected branch

    user = item[0]
    values = item[1:]
    if user not in totals:

2126,1557852864.1037,Hiroko,by `other class methods` do you mean methods in the same class?
2126,1557854764.1047,Javier,Yes
2126,1557854804.1051,Sasha,You can call them as `self.func()`.

2140,1557922633.2141,Harley,Sorry i think i paste wrong code.Yes exactly when i append my code with try except block but although there has been occured connection error between lambda and backend  http endpoint the code did not raise an exception and getting lambda execution timeout (60 second); I write correct code block again now; None; None; The below execption block do not raise any exception when i remove SG rule between lambda and backend API so lambda execute code and goes down to the lambda timeout without any exeception.I have increase lambda timeout value from 60 to 600 step by step each test but everytime i have got only lambda timeout so it did not hang and raise any exception.

2143,1557927688.2225,Hiroko,"if anything, I think logging would be much more flexible; because you can then route your log output to a handler which can execute different things; eg, send an email with too many ERRORs occurring; post to a log aggregator; etc; in other words, <@Clarita> I would kill print in favor of logging just because; using lots of print statements over logging in a project is a major code smell to me"
2143,1557927893.2267,Clarita,"undoubtedly logging is superior for flexibility, can’t argue that. but i’m trying to reduce memory use first and foremost, and since I don’t really know the internals of `print` just wondering if it is somehow a very costly process"
2143,1557927918.2273,Hiroko,"print uses the OS system calls, IIRC; so its pretty low level"
2143,1557927933.2279,Clarita,certainly in terms of time print is killing our program
2143,1557927947.2284,Hiroko,"FWIW, you really should be using levels in output; eg, INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG; sounds like lots of your output is debug and could be avoided with proper logging levels; eg, you want one env to have debug output, but not another.  just change the log level in the env config"
2143,1557928068.2311,Clarita,"thanks <@Hiroko>, unfortunately I work with a bunch of non-engineers who built this code base who didn’t about logging, and this is what I’m working with now :disappointed:"

2143,1557928550.2334,Clarita,and re: logging. I can’t recall if you have log level set to ERROR will a statement like `<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>(f'{calculate_string()}')` actually execute and compile that string and not print it? or does it skip the entire line like a no-op?

Is there a cleaner/more pythonic way to do this than:

```

2145,1557934246.2407,Clemmie,you can bucket them by the value in `x.split(':')[0]` which will give you the hour portion of each string
2145,1557934269.2413,Magdalena,I'll have a list of dynamic bucket sizes and I could have a bucket size that's like 9:30-11:00

I essentially wanted to see if I could write the equivalent class to a `float` but have it check &amp; possibly convert units prior to using them for any math. It's done by using a class, `Quantity`, which uses `float` as its base class. Now, if I want to check units before adding 2 Quantities, I can define an `__add__` func which performs the check, and then returns a result if the units are compatible with a call to `self._check_compatibility`.

What I was wondering is, for the return line here, having `super().__add__(o)` looks wrong to me. The code works as I want it to, but I wanted to know if there's a better way of adding to these default class dunder methods where the process you want is: 1- do some check, 2- use the base class's standard method, 3- cast the result to something else

```def __add__(self, other):
    # returns other, unmodified, or converted to a compatible 'Quantity' class
    o = self._check_compatibility(other)

I have tried updating pip without have the virtualenvironment active, upgrading pip in virtual environment.

2178,1558129359.057,Nigel,"Well, kinda; You can see pip bundled with python here: <https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/e42b705188271da108de42b55d9344642170aa2b/Lib/ensurepip/_bundled>"

2179,1558129508.0611,Sterling,I used to use virtualenv but recently I saw that python docs were recommending `python3 -m venv tutorial-env`.

2179,1558129562.0626,Nigel,"&gt; Do you know if there is any reason why they suggest that module now over virtualenv package I used to use?
The reason is that they'be brought virtualenv into the distribution of python; I don't know if I'm correct, but I'm pretty sure about it; There are also tools which help you with creating virtual environments without thinking too much about them. The best of such tools is called poetry: <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry>"

It takes time to update that version in `virtualenv`, `venv` and other packages. So, on your system `pip` will always be lagging behind unless you upgrade it right after creating venv."

2179,1558130966.0728,Sterling,I do; I have a mac and python2 was preinstalled. But I installed python3 via homebrew. When I rune the venv module though I do run `python3 -m venv new-venv`. Do you think python2 is interfering somehow?

2181,1558135289.0781,Sasha,"So, the main `for` loop is looking at every possible starting position for `""bob""` in the string. It might be at position 0, 1, all the way up to 3 characters from the end of the string (since you need to have room for `""bob""` left).; Then if it sees a `""b""` at one of those positions, it enters the inner `for` loop, where it checks each character in `""bob""` for a match. It exits the loop immediately if there's a mismatch, but if it completes the loop successfully, the `else` clause fires, and it increments a counter for how many `""bob""`s it has found.; (I'm assuming you already know stuff like the `[]` notation for array indexing, etc. But feel free to ask about anything that's unclear. The `for-else` syntax is uncommon in other languages, for instance.)"

1. For x in range(0,len(s)-len(find)+1)... Why is there +1 in that line of code?
2. For I in range(0, len(find)).... could you please explain more on it

2184,1558185732.0838,Ashley,"That has to do with how you specify the stopping point for the range. Take a look at the range that's produced with and without the `+1` to see how it's impacted, and it should become a bit more clear"
2184,1558209033.0861,Hisako,"`len(s)-len(find)+1` produces a number; so

for x in range(0,len(s)-len(find)+1):

2201,1558302120.1514,Damien,"No, the whole point is its _not_ on the system. I think I'll need to look for some pyinstaller specific forum for the information i need."
2199,1558302292.1523,Nigel,Then it means that you bundle the python together with executable. Which means that you should know where the bundled python is. How else could you expect to run `python -m`?

2208,1558361843.2158,Leanora,Sure. Thanks <@Carlee> <@Clemmie>. I'll look into that article.
2210,1558366386.2168,Johna,i feel bad for the team that decided to do that as asyncio was documented to be added just two months after this article; wait i’m confused… reading now and they’re citing asyncio /shrug; what is aiohttp? if not asyncio
2210,1558366946.2179,Hiroko,its a web server/client based on asyncio
2211,1558368043.2196,Arturo,"hi all, need a bit of help with vm's if I have a virtual machine that is running something on it, but want to create a shared folder that another computer can access, do I simply create a shared folder?; this virtual machine has its own ip"
2211,1558368145.2207,Claudine,"seems about right, if your VM can access your network I'd think you're set up nicely"
2211,1558368394.2224,Arturo,"ok so my thought process is, create a shared folder, once the process running on the vm has finished it generates a file and saves it in the shared folder, then the other person can see it and use that file; managed to do it, but what is interesting is that I cannot share just one folder on the using the Microsoft vm, on VM ware I have done this before, but this only lets me share the c drive"
2212,1558375080.2252,Jorge,"This code returns either a matching element ( where `dog['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper'`) or an empty dict.

Is there a simple way to transform this so that it returns either single element or *None*?"
2212,1558375170.2259,Clemmie,replace `else {}` with `else None`
2212,1558375187.2262,Jorge,that gives me an ~NoneType~ Attribute error
2212,1558375281.2274,Sasha,I think you can tag an `or None` on to the end of the expression to transform the empty dict case.
2212,1558375322.2279,Jorge,"ah, cool; that works, thanks"
2212,1558375452.2295,Sasha,"You might double-check if the `reduce()` works correctly if `'Dr. Pupper'` is the final element in the list. Since you're not using `y`, I'm a little suspicious that it will skip that case."
2212,1558375544.2298,Jorge,"oh, that doesnt work"
2212,1558375574.2304,Sasha,Actually it might not work for anything but the first element.
2212,1558375620.2309,Jorge,"yea, i think thats the case. and if i switch to using y, i'll miss out on if it is the first element"
2212,1558375695.2312,Sasha,Can you use `filter()` instead?
2212,1558375770.2324,Jorge,i guess. my impression is that you want to use `filter` when you are going from *list* -&gt; *smaller list* and `reduce` when you are going from *list* -&gt; *any*
2212,1558375950.2338,Sasha,"I tend to conceptualize it as using `filter()` when you're looking at properties of a single item, `map()` when you're operating on single items, and `reduce()` when you are operating on pairs of items.; Hahaha, how about `max(dogs, key=lambda x: x['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper')`?"
2212,1558376199.2351,Jettie,just never use reduce :); then you only have map and filter to worry about; everybody wins
2212,1558376341.2378,Jorge,"lol the max function works.
as for filter, it just looks kind of ugly having to do something like:
```
my_filter = filter(lambda x: x['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper', dogs)
dog = list(my_filter)[0]
```
or actually, more like:
```
my_filter = filter(lambda x: x['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper', dogs)
if len(list(my_filter)):
    dog = list(my_filter)[0]
else:
    dog = None
```"
2212,1558376404.2387,Sasha,"Actually, the `max()` option won't work in the negative case, since it'll return another item.; This may work: `max(x if x.get('name') == 'Dr. Pupper' else None for x in dogs)`"
2212,1558376732.2406,Brain,what if there are more than 1 matching element?
2212,1558376782.2412,Sasha,It'll just pick one semi-arbitrarily... I think dicts are compared by memory address or something.
2212,1558376884.2427,Jorge,"for more than one element, that probably means I have a data error, and i'll probably want to throw an exception.
Maybe trying to make this into a one liner is a bit of a stretch"
2213,1558377081.2455,Brain,"if it should not return every matching element, than personally I’d rather go with simple loop to be able to `break` when there is a match instead of continue looking.
Also from my experience python one-liners (or any language one-liners) are cool, but many beginners have difficulties understanding them."
2213,1558377145.2462,Holly,I've been using python for a good while and one liners are still difficult for me to understand lol

2214,1558379358.2507,Raguel,how do you guys version APIs? I see arguments for and against putting it in URI
2214,1558379600.2513,Jettie,where else could you put it? :o
2214,1558379747.2515,Karoline,as a header
2214,1558379766.252,Raguel,"yeah, header vs uri"
2214,1558379793.2525,Karoline,I like URI personally; I can see why some people don't though
2214,1558379820.2531,Clemmie,I like uri also - easier to test/prototype against
2214,1558380172.2538,Jettie,it's also easier to manage; you could have v1 and v2 point to different app servers; or introduce a delay to /v1/ if you want users to migrate to v2 faster
2214,1558380232.2549,Rikki,how it is easier to manage?; what do you mean by that; then difference is semantical only there is no management troubles; header vs uri is preference only
2214,1558380363.2567,Hiroko,"for testing purposes and sheer ease of use, use URI; if you want to get fancy, use header; but to be honest, if an API made me use versions in header for unauthed endpoints, I’d be annoyed"
2214,1558380461.259,Rikki,"I dont see difference seriously, I would even say headers make sense"
2214,1558380465.2594,Clemmie,"If you are pedantic about what REST means, use headers (as with URI you would end up with multiple endpoints for the same(?) resource)'"
2214,1558380471.2596,Rikki,especially when you use accept-version header; or accept content type
2214,1558380508.2606,Clemmie,"<@Rikki> how do I quick-explore an api in a browser with headers?; I think headers can be fine, but your documentation needs to be that much better"
2214,1558380538.2617,Rikki,why would you think exploring api in browser is something you should do?
2214,1558380540.2618,Jettie,"different locations in nginx and that's it

with headers it's a bit more cumbersome"
2214,1558380566.2623,Rikki,"btw you should explore documentation, rather api itself"

2214,1558380619.2635,Clemmie,"you should, yes. I am doing AWS stuff right now. If the only option for AWS was the documentation then no one would be able to use the bulk of AWS services; And they have the resources to make good documentation. they just….don’t"
2214,1558380734.2641,Claudine,^; AWS documentation is super amazing in some spots and almost non-existent in other spots; or they do one very specific estoeric example for their code and that's it; I've gotten much better at making assumptions for what is correct lately though

2215,1558383152.2766,Raguel,going with uri version for now -- seems easier :parrot:; I wanna know more about it!
2215,1558383644.2769,Claudine,"well so im required to support Basic Auth, so I do it with an API Gateway Authorizer function and the following setup:
  - Multiple groups, each group has an inline policy allowing a specific HTTP method on the specific API Gateway endpoints a user in the group can access
  - A User is created, assigned to a group, and an access key is generated for the user
  - To authenticate, the user provides their Username and Password (access key) when making a request
  - The lambda function parses the credentials from the request, pulls up the user and verifies the access key.
 - If the user is authenticated, their group is pulled up, the groups inline policy is parsed into a set of `Method: endpoint`s
 - an access policy is generated on the fly based off that set and returned by the authorizer function; So If I want to adjust permissions, I just edit the group's inline policy. If i want to give a new user access with a given set of permission, i just create a new user, assign to a group, and them give them their username/access_key; since they don't have the secret key they really can't do anything they haven't been given explicit permission to do; I also needed to version all of this, so I've defined all the user/group/policy stuff in a `serverless` yml file"
2215,1558384755.2777,Raguel,"sweet -- I need to learn how to do this directly in API gateway. Currently I am using APIGEE which allows us to do most of it.; You create one API, and then create different products out of it with access to different endpoints; it was just Apigee makes it easier, but I want to try everything on API gateway so that there is not other layer"
2215,1558385770.2785,Claudine,"It wasn't too bad for me, I just read API Gateway Authorizer docs, it essentially hooks up a lambda to handle everything, and then you can do whatever you want in that lambda; So setting it up is easily just the implementation is tough"
2217,1558386319.2791,Isabel,How do you contribute to open source projects
2217,1558386416.2799,Jorge,"depends on the project, but usually checkout their repo + issues, and see if there's a beginner friendly issue to work on.
you'll probably have to be familiar with git; i would say the easiest, most beginner friendly way is to trawl their documentation for typos, fix them, and then make a PR"

Not interested in knowing who's doing what exactly, but I would like to know how many unique apps or people are calling the API instead of knowing all the separate API calls without any context. And since users are not logged in there's no way to tell if 1 guy is calling the API 1000 times or 1000 users are calling it once"
2221,1558449427.3004,Hiroko,"without any kind of identifier coming from the client, no; you can look at user agent strings for identifying the clients being used; but as far as unique identifiers, if you’re not requiring that being part of the API call, how would such a method work?"

2221,1558449546.3035,Eliana,lol. yea you would have to try and use existing information which isn’t perfect but you could extrapolate quite a bit. you also have to ask if you want that kind of overhead.
2221,1558449548.3037,Dawn,Don't have a lot of experience in this field
2221,1558449566.3041,Eliana,the user agent string as <@Hiroko> suggested but it can easily be spoofed.; you could create some kind of compound key such as user agent string and ip address.
2221,1558449626.3056,Dawn,But are user agent string and IP address always sent with the request in the headers?
2221,1558449629.3057,Carlo,even IP address is not perfectly reliable
2221,1558449649.3068,Eliana,yep that’s why i said it isn’t going to be perfect.
2221,1558449658.3071,Dawn,Nah I didn't expect 100% reliability but something that's getting close to some form of grouping that would be nice
2221,1558449658.3072,Carlo,honestly anything that's received by the client should be seen as unreliable; depends on how reliable you need this to be; but yeah if you're okay with some fuziness then id go with something hand-rolled li a IP/UA compound as <@Eliana> said
2221,1558449716.309,Eliana,i think it’s ok to assume what normal users would do. they probably won’t be changing their user client or ip address. if you are more worried about crackers or script kiddies then it’s going to be REALLY tough.
2221,1558449753.3097,Carlo,IP is unreliable with VPN users too

2231,1558487507.3792,Vern,"Hello, I am looking for some direction I am trying to figure out how to apply a bias to a random.  Selecting random number between 1 and 1000 a large number of times will average to 500 with even distribution.  What I want to be able to do is apply a bias such that all numbers are still selected but with a bias to select a low or a high number more often (resulting in lower or higher average), or a middle bias, such that the average is still 500 but numbers closer to 500 are selected with a higher frequency then numbers Further away"
2231,1558488463.3819,Sasha,"There's lots of ways to potentially do that, depending on the degree of bias you want. For the low/high case, you could generate a random number between 1 and 1500, and take the range between 1001-1500 to be a duplicate of the 1-500 or 501-1000 range, giving you an extra chance of landing there. For a middle bias, you could generate two numbers 1-500 and sum them, which would tend to cluster towards the center like a pair of dice are more likely to roll 7.; In the most general case, you could figure out exactly the probability distribution you want, and then convert a uniform random number into that distribution with a mapping function."

Any tips? I was thinking one approach is to remove m1 and m2 from the monthly list to sum separately before running the rest through the regular aggregator"
2233,1558503310.4055,Sasha,"You could set `offset = -10`, and then do `[sum(monthly[max(i, 0):i+12]) for i in range(offset, len(monthly), 12)]`."

2234,1558505319.4241,Sasha,"It executes the lambda, returning a multiple of `2`.; The list should be 5 elements, from `range(5)`."
2234,1558505417.4256,Leida,but multiplier would be a list of lambdas so how would a lambda get called there?; isnt the array single element with lambda in side where the range is inside the lamda?
2234,1558505450.4266,Sasha,"`create_multipliers()` returns a list, and `for multiplier` iterates over each element."

2234,1558505668.4287,Leida,":smile: im reading about python cotchas - this result is an example of latebinding closures; i made an error in reading it so it i couldnt figure out how this gotcha works; ```Five functions are created; instead all of them just multiply x by 4.

Python’s closures are late binding. This means that the values of variables used in closures are looked up at the time the inner function is called.

Here, whenever any of the returned functions are called, the value of i is looked up in the surrounding scope at call time. By then, the loop has completed and i is left with its final value of 4.```"
2234,1558505883.4304,Sasha,Yikes. I would have failed that interview question. I'm still not sure what scope `i` still exists in at call time.
2234,1558505909.4309,Leida,"if you replace the list with a generator it works tho; ok i think i got it now; python has some cotchas but seems to have alot less of em than say javascript; the article im reading gives some workarounds but it it fails to use generators which makes it so that the range isnt iterated over before the for loop and everything is fine; ```using a default arg like so:

def create_multipliers():
    return [lambda x, i=i : i * x for i in range(5)]
Alternatively, you can use the functools.partial function:

from functools import partial
from operator import mul

def create_multipliers():
    return [partial(mul, i) for i in range(5)]```; the default arg route makes the whole thing even messier xD; give that line as an interview question :smiling_imp:"

            body: err.body
          })
          myFunction(message, callback, destination)```; FYI to test the code I'm working on, it needs to pass two people and often takes up to 3 days. I'm to fresh into JS to be able to write a similar function to test this; So maybe I already got it or I'm missing something trivial. Great if you have some input"
2235,1558510848.4436,Deangelo,"no worries, this is easy, one sec"

      payload: err.statusMessage,
      body: err.body

2235,1558511031.4446,Conchita,"Awesome - can you please explain `message,`? What happens on that line?"
2235,1558511120.4448,Deangelo,"sure, it's declaring a constant variable named `message`. its value is a string literal. string literals allow you to inject dynamic values in them.; as a result, the string literal ```
Error encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}```"
2235,1558511164.4453,Conchita,"Ok great, was just about to ask if the constant could still access the variable ""err.status"", but you just answered it too; Thank you so much!"
2235,1558511208.4458,Deangelo,"becomes:
```
Error encountered when syncing with status: 500

when err.status has the value 500 for example; yep"
2235,1558511273.4463,Conchita,"One bonus question - for this function. My function takes in a callback as an argument. The issue is that, not all blocks of code where I need to call this function ahve a callback defined.; Should I then modify my code to hav ethe callback as an optional argument or is there better solution for this?; An example is the snippet you just helped me with; It has no defined callback, but other code blocks do where it is required"
2235,1558511400.4471,Deangelo,"ok, you can definitely make the callback optional; by checking if it's passed of not; ```

2240,1558522701.4715,Amparo,"Hi guys, I'm new for Python. Here I'm from Coldfusion background. And I'm using sublime text. How do I run my first py file ?"
2240,1558522895.472,Leida,if you have python installed then running `python filename.py` does the trick; if you are looking for something that runs the file from sublime then there might be some addon for that
2240,1558522934.4732,Amparo,Where I should run. Generally in coldfusion I run the test file like localhost:8500/test.cfm; Okay I tried with open the particular file in IDLE.
2240,1558522985.4743,Leida,ah so you wish to run it through testserver web api?
2240,1558522990.4745,Amparo,And I can ran it by press f5; It;s will display the result
2240,1558523016.4756,Leida,if you open command line in the folder that the file is in you can run the command i mentioned; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551735/how-do-i-run-python-code-from-sublime-text-2>
2240,1558523049.4768,Amparo,"Again I changed something in my sublime , And Do I need to reopen that file in IDLE and run again ? is this only option ?"
2240,1558523054.477,Leida,with this you can run it in the editor which does a similar thing in the background; you dont need to open it in IDLE; python isnt a compiled language so you dont need to run anything extra before running the script
2240,1558523172.4784,Amparo,None
2240,1558523346.48,Leida,you dont seem to have python in your path. Have you installed python?
2240,1558523380.4806,Amparo,"My question is, If I open test.py file in both sublime &amp; IDLE. Then if once I change something in sublime that will not reflect in IDLE; Yes. I can successfully run it via IDLE"
2240,1558523476.4819,Leida,um you would need to reload the file in IDLE for the updates to show. I dont know if IDLE has some setting to keep track of file changes or not. In general if you use sublime then you dont need to use IDLE; IDLE is a small editor that comes with the python installation
2240,1558523518.4833,Amparo,Yes. So could you please help to run the py file via sublime
2240,1558523520.4835,Leida,open up command prompt (windows key + r) and type in cmd; this will open up command prompt for you
2240,1558523553.4847,Amparo,Each and every time I type the code in sublime and open the file in IDLE and press f5.. That was I'm doing each and every changes
2240,1558523570.4851,Leida,then type in `python` and tell me what it says
2240,1558523593.4854,Amparo,"Internal &amp; external command issue; python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file."
2240,1558523674.4865,Leida,"ok that means python is not in your path. That basically means that if you type python the executable is not found. This is what sublime does to find python.; you can follow this to add python to your path <https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/>; then do the sublime settings thing and then you can run python by pressing crtl+b; windows installation for python has a section where you can choose features, adding to path is one of them and by default it is off. Most any program that needs to use python will want python to be on path so you generally need to set it to install it.; If the guide is too complex you can try running python installer again, there you can add that feature"
2240,1558524494.4897,Amparo,<@Leida>; I can see a version while go in to C &gt;&gt; Python34 &gt;&gt; python --version
2240,1558524536.4912,Leida,that is because python is installed in the Python34 folder
2240,1558524539.4914,Amparo,I can't see the version while C&gt;&gt;User&gt;&gt;userName &gt;&gt; python -- version; DO I need to create a environment variable now ?
2240,1558524561.4923,Leida,"but you want to be able to access python from any folder; yes, you still dont have python in your path"
2240,1558524610.4932,Amparo,Okay. Then How I can install by default ? I mean inside program file instead of python34.; Is this possible ?; Got it Karl Uibo
2240,1558524820.4946,Leida,the easiest solution would be to re-run the installer and add the option to add python to path - that should fix your woes.
2240,1558524973.4953,Amparo,"So you mean instead of install python in c:python34, We should install it in c:programfiles:python34 ?; So that we no need to create environment variable / mapping etc..; Right ?"
2240,1558525083.4961,Hiroko,no
2240,1558525104.4969,Amparo,So How I can debug my code here ?
2240,1558525106.497,Hiroko,we mean uninstall and reinstall with the pythin installer and check the option to add to path
2240,1558525134.4976,Amparo,Yes. I choose by default path that is c:python43.
2240,1558525147.4981,Hiroko,"NO, not that path; system path"
2240,1558525156.4985,Amparo,Okay
2240,1558525167.499,Hiroko,<https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html>
2240,1558525176.4993,Amparo,Now How I can debug my code. Is there any function for that.
2240,1558525187.4996,Hiroko,there’s a checkbox for that in the install to do that for you
2240,1558525199.4999,Amparo,I mean developer debugging function anything ?
2240,1558525220.0004,Hiroko,"well, first, don’t use IDLE"
2240,1558525227.0008,Amparo,Yes <@Hiroko> I did that already
2240,1558525231.0012,Hiroko,I have no clue why its still included in the install
2240,1558525240.0017,Amparo,Now I can ran the sample code via sublime

2240,1558525323.0034,Hiroko,"ok; but that’s not what we were saying; we were saying system path in windows so its available to run outside with just the `python` command; without needing to provide the entire `c:\python34.bin/python` path when executing your file; now, as far as debugging; I haven’t used sublime with python before; have you looked for sublime packages for this?; eg <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20Debugger>?; uhm… question; why are you installing python 3.4?; if you’re starting out, why not use 3.7?"

2240,1558525740.0121,Amparo,That will redirect to other link
2240,1558525758.0123,Hiroko,"that’s exactly what I’m pointing to with the link above.  sublime is an editor, not an IDE"
2240,1558525767.0127,Amparo,Got it
2240,1558525769.0129,Hiroko,so you need to add in the packages you want for the desired capability
2240,1558525807.0133,Amparo,Fine. Now back to debugging concept ?; I'm asking find bug and debug . For ex)  if I pass the argument to the function mean How I can check the argument received to that functions or what values come for that particular arguments etc... Like developer debugging tool.
2240,1558525844.0142,Hiroko,"I already answered that for you :slightly_smiling_face:; you’re using sublime; that’s an editor, not an IDE.  So if you want that, you need to install packages for that functionality; check out <https://realpython.com/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/> for some good package and configuration suggestions for ST"
2240,1558525896.0162,Amparo,Fpr example in coldfusion if I dump( argument ) it will show all argument with its value in structure format. If I did abort(). then next line of any code will not excute; Sure. I will take a look on your link <@Hiroko> Thank you
2240,1558525968.017,Hiroko,"ok, gotcha.  I think you’re going to find a very different experience with non coldfusion languages"
2240,1558525980.0175,Amparo,Yes :slightly_smiling_face:
2240,1558525987.0177,Hiroko,"FWIW, I have java, c, php, javascript and python experience; none of those languages really have similar things; well, php has `var_dump`"
2240,1558526043.0197,Amparo,Yes you got it my point clearly
2240,1558526044.0199,Hiroko,"you can do the same in python with `print(globals()`, and `print(locals())`"
2240,1558526046.02,Leida,"<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows> you can try the community edition to see if that works for you, but you would still have to learn to use it first"
2240,1558526059.0204,Amparo,So there is any way for it ?
2240,1558526079.021,Hiroko,how many IDEs are there for CF?
2240,1558526137.0215,Amparo,"Sublime, Vs code, coldfusion builder ( By default )"
2240,1558526191.0219,My,So. Many. Notifications. :smile:
2240,1558526219.0223,Leida,you can try with vs code too <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/debugging%20python>
2240,1558526282.0228,Amparo,"Huh using VS code it's slow my system; Even I'm having good configuration system; So generally vs code take more time to load, Hang on.. etc..; So I always give priority to sublime text only :slightly_smiling_face:; Any feedback about my point <@Leida> <@My> <@Hiroko>"
2240,1558526422.0255,Leida,if you dont use an ide which are more heavy weight then you are gonna have to put in more elbow grease to get things to work; can be a bit of fiddling and i personally havent worked with sublime to know what needs to be done
2240,1558526465.0266,Amparo,SO you mean IDLE is best by default ?
2240,1558526520.0274,My,personnally I never run code inside of sublime
2240,1558526528.0277,Leida,"aparently it does have a debugger inbulit - never used it. Certainly not the best, but is probably relatively light weight. <https://www.cs.uky.edu/~keen/help/debug-tutorial/debug.html>"

2242,1558528683.036,Alvina,no - one is on windows (C: drive) and the other is /usr/bin/git; did not realize that would matter - I thought it used the .git subfolder to keep track; let me switch pycharm to use the /usr/bin WSL path instead to see if that clears things up

Have anybody unittested - sqlalchemy? I have a case similar to here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44539816/real-unit-testing-of-sqlalchemy-in-flask>
- I think the answer is great - I would say exactly the same…
Before seeing it I took approach with mocking necessary objects. I hit the wall when I got the the part of code that creates the query part in `filter`:
```
... _and(my_table.columns.datetime &gt;= datetime(2018, 1, 1))
```
MagicMocks are not comparable :slightly_smiling_face:

I’m also thinking of changing the approach and using something like `betamax` for db - is there a library like that for sqlalchemy?"
2251,1558556765.0617,Karoline,"are you trying to mock the deep behavior of SQLAlchemy itself?; I think the best approach is going to be a mix of things though - isolating your database access and accessing it through an interface as is mentioned in #4 in the accepted answer there is good for testing most of your code, then you can just replace that interface.; then when doing fuller integration tests, there's no replacement for a real database in my opinion.; test against the version of the db you deploy against."
2251,1558557068.0656,Gisela,basically the class is a simple client working with defined interface; I just didn’t want to skip it from coverage
2251,1558557213.0678,Karoline,"if it's a simple client gluing together calls to a db, honestly the only value you'll really get form testing it will be testing it against a real db."
2251,1558557294.0691,Gisela,"what I wanted to achieve is to test if two queries in the method were called; I know it’s simple test, that could’ve been covered probably by testing with test db instance, I just want to know how to test properly as an unittest - more for learning reasons - I just don’t like the idea of “it cannot be unittested”"
2251,1558557511.0728,Karoline,"you  can mock it as you've said.  not sure how much value there is there though, really."
2251,1558557554.0736,Gisela,"with that version of testing there’s still problem of the comparison of mocks; let’s call it academic reason :wink:; the problem is in the deeper magic of sqlalchemy (how it creates queries and `compare`) - I would have to add it to mocked objects, and that’s too much…"
2251,1558557741.0765,Karoline,"oh - I think see, sorry, I see you had a more concrete issue, I thought you were more speaking generally.; you can override `__eq__`; on the mocked object, to return True"
2251,1558557800.0784,Gisela,"tried to do that with `__le__`,  to `__gt__`; as there’s ‘&gt;=’"
2251,1558557822.0792,Krystal,Is it ok to fetch and parse an RSS feed in short time intervals? Is it harmful for the RSS link provider?
2251,1558557884.0797,Karoline,"you want `__ge__` then, right?"
2251,1558557908.0801,Gisela,"yes - didn’t work, but I’ll double check, although I did not add `__eq__` there"
2251,1558557928.0803,Karoline,there's some discussion here: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#magic-mock>; with some examples.  should work.
2251,1558558290.0815,Gisela,thx :slightly_smiling_face:; and regarding way of testing with something like a “record”?; is there a lib like that for sqlalchemy? Like `betamax`?
2251,1558558453.0846,Karoline,"maybe, but I'm not sure how much of a good idea that is. isolate that code and mock it at the boundaries of tests for your business logic, and test it in integration tests against a real database.; a unittest of basically sqlalchemy code is just testing that sqlalchemy works.; you know that - what you want to know is if everything works at the integration points"
2251,1558558638.0856,Gisela,"that’s true; implementing `__le__` worked, I had to double check the `return_value....__le__` path :slightly_smiling_face:"
2251,1558558759.0878,Karoline,ah yeah it can always be tricky to make sure you have it all just right

2254,1558563041.0953,Clemmie,You can also do `return self.last_name == other.last_name` you don't need to check the comparison and then return the same statement
2253,1558566404.0957,Sasha,One solution: `dt = __import__('datetime').datetime.utcfromtimestamp`
2255,1558582127.0971,Lynnette,I think that `__import__` has been deprecated in favor of the `importlib` module; although I still use it.
2256,1558596513.0984,Rubie,Is there a way i can check my code is Thread Safe?
2256,1558597504.1002,Guillermina,"It will be safe, you have the GIL working for you...
<https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock>"
2256,1558598613.1014,Chester,"It won't, the GIL only protects the internal state of the interpreter. You can still have races in your python code.; <@Rubie> unfortunately, there is no automated way. This is why threads are such a pain"
2256,1558598686.1023,Rubie,"Ok I've been asked to write a program which is thread safe, is there any obvious things i should avoid?; Stupid question incoming... is multithreading thread safe?"
2257,1558599466.1038,Leida,it depends what you need really
2256,1558599472.1042,Carlee,"First we have to understand what's meant by ""Thread Safety""; from wikipedia
&gt; Thread safety is a computer programming concept applicable to multi-threaded code. Thread-safe code only manipulates shared data structures in a manner that ensures that all threads behave properly and fulfill their design specifications without unintended interaction. There are various strategies for making thread-safe data structures."
2256,1558599604.107,Leida,if you have some processing running in another thread that does not depend on any data in your main logic other than what you give it at the start and it does not need access to any shared data then its safe; as long as you dont have mutable shared state you should be fine
2256,1558599708.109,Guillermina,"Thanks for the question <@Rubie> - today I learned something...
Here's a good read on the topic: <https://opensource.com/article/17/4/grok-gil>

&gt; So, despite the GIL, you still need locks to protect shared mutable state [if the operation is not atomic]"
2256,1558599751.1098,Leida,for example i was doing USB communications in a separate thread because it was really slow and i needed my main logic to do other stuff at the same time so i could push that USB communications into a separate thread and do other stuff until the code in the other thread was ready to give me the output
2256,1558599840.1111,Carlee,Shared mutable state is evil
2256,1558599843.1113,Leida,so you can have multithreaded software without worries of thread safety IF the task you are trying to accomplish can be done in that way; so your question of having been asked to write multithreaded software that is thread safe can be relatively trivial or a nightmare depending on the actual task
2256,1558600043.1135,Rubie,"Yeah i think i understand better, <@Guillermina> that article is a good source."
2258,1558600124.1138,Philip,"Hi, which library should I use to convert the data ```contact_info = {

2259,1558602745.1187,Rubie,"Sorry to be a pain, but is sorted() thread safe? how do i check this :cry:; Or how can i check if operations are atomic or not"
2259,1558602977.1199,Carlee,"as far as I know `sorted` is thread safe because it makes a copy of the list and doesn't mutate the original list.; I guess the key is to understand ""shared mutable state""....
- mutable state is thead safe if its not shared
- shared state is thread safe if its not mutable."
2260,1558603654.1225,Leida,as the article explained `sorted` is thread safe by being a single bytecode and thus uninterruptable by GIL
2259,1558603703.1229,Leida,ah there is `sort` there not `sorted`
2260,1558603732.1235,Leida,"but you can follow the same example and use `dis.dis()`; oh, really Shoviks answer pretty much covers it anyway; ```&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():

2263,1558627340.1406,Holly,"generally if you're making an api, you'd want another library that handles the database queries; like sqlalchemy; and when someone sends an api request for some data, you pass that data to a function and that function performs the lookup in the database and returns it; that allows you to control what type of data gets sent to your database, so someone can't just put in a query into the api call and then get all the information in your database"

I have a class `App` using `requests` I would like to write some test but instead of mocking each `requests` call I would like to use a stub object that respect the api in order to test App

```

class App:

# some requests with autocompletions
  <http://self_.request.post|self_.request.post>(""<http://github.com>"", data=""stuff"")
  self_.request.get(""<http://github.com>"")
# in my test the ""request"" is stub or mocked

The problem is that call the method implemented in Node"
2276,1558694727.0378,Nigel,"<@Greta> There is a thing in python called ""name mangling"" which happens if you prefix a variable or a function with double underscore like in `__define_node` case. When you do this, at runtime this method turns into a `_ClassName__define_node` for the parent class and for all subclasses to emulate ""private"" keyword from C++ or Java. You can read about it here: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atom-identifiers> and here: <https://stackoverflow.com/q/7456807/3606603>

In your particular case, if you want to reuse `__define_node` from the parent class, you should change its name to `_define_node` - with a single leading underscore"

2291,1558791409.1183,Vern,"Good morning.  I am working with Panadas for the first time, and so far really liking it.  I am trying to do some analysis on phone records.  long term there are a few things I want to do, but focus right now is determining maximum number of concurrent calls to the PSTN at an individual location.  I have functioning code for this, but pretty sure there is a much better way of doing this (this works, but its slow).  the part below is the part I'm sure there is a better way.  prior to this snippet of code I am reading the CSV file(125 column, 15000 rows) into a dataframe, filtering it down to just the PSTN Calls, and just the columns I used for that purpose I end out with a dataframe that is is about 10250x6.  I'm then running it through loop below to poll the data and check minute by minute in my interested time period how many calls were active at the polling time.  This works ok, but it is slow, and I'm going to be missing data still (calls that start and end between polling periods), There are a few ways I can think of to catch those calls as well but it's going to make this even slower..is there a better way I should be doing this?  The idea is with the output then I can quickly find the max calls, I can graph the data show trending,  etc.
```
# create empty Dataframe to store results
call_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['dateTime', 'activeCalls'])

# Loop through times in one minute incremenets between start and end time
for x in pd.date_range(start=start_time, end=end_time, freq=""1Min""):
    # count number of calls that started before and ended after loop time
    active_calls = len(pstn_calls[(pstn_calls['origTime'] &lt;= x) &amp; pstn_calls['disconnectTime'] &gt;= x)])
    # append results to DataFrame
    call_df = call_df.append({'dateTime': x, 'activeCalls': active_calls}, ignore_index=True)
```"
2291,1558799948.1204,Sasha,"<@Vern> A couple of things come to mind. One solution would be to start with an array of zeroes for every minute you want to get statistics for, and then loop through each call record once, adding a one for every minute between the start time and end time.; Another way would be to sort the start times and end times, and perform a running sum, so you'd end up with a list of times at which the concurrent call count changed, and to what new value."

2296,1558807673.1414,Sasha,It may be that the pipe is buffering output somewhere. You might try adding `flush=True` to your `print` call in your connector script.; There's also a `-u` flag you can pass to `python` to get unbuffered output.

2305,1558939848.1816,Christina,"that depends on your OS. this is not really a python question, as it is simply depended on whether `python`is symlinked to `python3.*` or `python2.*` (on unix systems anyway..)

What OS are you using?"
2305,1558939980.1818,Chester,"Also, linking `python` to `python3` when your linux distro has it linked to `python2` will likely break everything"
2305,1558939989.182,Christina,"true!; so it also depends on which distro you use. but i hope the majority of your packages rely on py3, but that is probably naive"
2305,1558940079.1824,Tanja,I'm using Ubuntu
2305,1558940098.1826,Chester,<@Tanja> I'd suggest to use <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>; This cannot possibly break anything
2305,1558940125.1831,Tanja,the Idea is that most packages I'm working with requires python3; I'm not working with virtual environment another way?
2305,1558940212.1835,Christina,You should use virtual environments. However you can (also) add a alias mapping py to python3 in your .bashrc/zshrc (or what ever shell you use)
2305,1558940294.1837,Chester,A virtual environment is bound to the interpreter used to create it. It cannot manage different python versions on the same machine; pyenv can
2305,1558940369.1841,Tanja,"if I used `locate python3` It gives looong &amp; many  paths, how should I knew which one I have to use"
2305,1558940369.1843,Christina,oic. well then pyenv should be your goto thing. but virtual environments are quite cool as well; use `which python3` not `locate python3` - locate finds all files that has `python3`it its name afaik
2305,1558940517.1848,Tanja,ok.
2305,1558940605.185,Christina,"`which python3` means ""upon writing `python3` which file is executed?`"
2305,1558940634.1852,Tanja,"another question please, If I want to work with pyenv, what will happen to the already downloaded packages, like pymesh, plt,and I have to reinstall all in the pyenv?"
2305,1558940776.1854,Chester,"Yes. As I said, virtual environments are bound to the interpreter used to create it. pyenv installs completely separate interpreters"
2305,1558940823.1856,Christina,<@Tanja> you hopefully use `requirements.txt` to save those :wink:
2305,1558940888.1858,Tanja,Sorry guys I don't ave advanced knowledge in python so I feel not getting exactly the idea you are talking about :disappointed:
2305,1558941471.1862,Christina,"It's more of a linux thing than i python thing. So when using pyenv it creates an isolated 'environment' which has a singular interpreter (a `python3` executeable basically). Linked to that interpreter is an isolated set of modules etc. So when changing into a new environment, you can only access the packages that is installed on that specific interpreter.
when activating a specific environment it creates an alias for that terminal that connects the command `python` to the specific interpreter. If you use Pycharm (the IDE / editor), you can also connect the editor to the specific environment. (probably the same for other editors)


Normally, when using python (especially with virtual environments) you define a file called `requirements.txt` which stores the names of all packages a given project is depended on. (<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files>)"
2305,1558942021.1866,Tanja,but does this mean I can remove all the packages (installed without pyenv) normally and this won't affect my new work on the pyenv
2305,1558942186.1868,Christina,"i think it depends on the setup. i haven't used pyenv (i use virtualenv, which is  similar), but some solutions makes en environment inherit from the global modules. but *i would* install everything in the env and then remove the global packages (just make sure it is packages that you hav manually installed, and not something ubuntu depends on)"
2305,1558942206.187,Chester,"pyenv and virtualenv are two completely different tools; pyenv manages different python interpreters (e.g. py2.6, py2.7, py3.5, py3.6, etc), virtualenv manages project-specific python packages (i.e. things that are installed with `pip install`)"
2305,1558942497.1874,Christina,oic. but isn't the packages still interpreter specific? :slightly_smiling_face:
2305,1558942526.1876,Chester,Sure
2306,1558944123.1878,Tanja,So as a beginner which one preferably to use; `virtualenv` or `pyenv`

2306,1558944720.1891,Jimmy,I don't really agree with that tbh; I python it's easy to make  `a.age` do something else thanks to `property` if needed later on
2305,1558944989.1921,Chester,"I have a very simple rule to decide whether a field should be a property or a method.
If computing this field requires I/O or any other sort of interactions with external systems (e.g. other classes that serve configuration), then it has to be a method.
If computing requires only the data available in `self`, then it should be a property.
If it requires no computing (i.e. the whole implementation is `return self._field`), then it should be just a regular field."
2306,1558945026.1923,Jimmy,nice rules :thumbsup:
2305,1558945730.193,Nigel,Plus one to <@Chester>'s rules of thumb. This MIT lecture is probably written by some old Java fart; <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLu2DFOdTg>
2307,1558946993.1949,Leida,getters and setters are from statically typed OOP languages; i think in C# or java was where all internal parameter access is reccommended to have getters and setters by default; its so that you wont have to modify your interfaces when you need to add something to the access like logging or counting or what not; its not a python thing to do. If you blindly bring OOP principles from c#/java to python you can end up with redundancy.
2307,1558947456.2004,Chester,"&gt; its so that you wont have to modify your interfaces when you need to add something to the access like logging or counting or what not
It's kinda stupid though. People make certain assumptions about how functions/methods operate.
If I see a `getName` method in java, I'd expect it to run blazingly fast - because it's essentially a field lookup. I'd call it a gazillion times without fear.
If it will do I/O tomorrow, then I'd have a hard time figuring why my program became so slow."

I have testcase written like below:

Now if first assert fail then other 2 assertion does not verified.
 I am looking for a way where one assertion fails does not stop execution of next line.
what is the way to achieve it"

2309,1558957899.241,Chester,"How you're going to check that?
You can't simply check for `display: none`. What if one fully functional control will be rendered outside of the viewport?; What if one control will completely overflow another?; You need to ask these questions to yourself, what kinds of UI changes you want to make, and I guarantee that ""all existing elements and controls, and their behaviors"" is not what you usually want to test"
2309,1558958022.2438,Jennette,ok
2309,1558958097.2451,Chester,"Let's say you want to test a click on a button. Why would you do that? It's already being tested during your browser's development process. All you need to do is to comply to the spec of the button.
Are you overriding default, well-tested behavior in javascript? Then test that javascript, because if you still test clicking on a button, then you're mostly testing browser's behavior, delegating the submit action to javascript"
2309,1558958125.2455,Jennette,ok
2309,1558958131.2457,Hiroko,"this brings up an additional question, are you doing unit testing too?; and if so, what’s your coverage for the code which executes the rendering and behavior?"

2309,1558961758.2498,Ashley,"<@Jennette> in order to avoid your tests taking an eternity to run, you basically want to avoid involving anything in any particular test that you don't absolutely need in order to test that behavior. So unless the actual core behavior you're testing depends on how that unique browser would behave, then you don't need to involve the browser."
2310,1558961828.251,Ashley,"For example, if your site has a standard `&lt;form&gt;`, and it doesn't use javascript to handle the submission on that form so it just `POST`s to a specific endpoint, then you don't need a browser to test that form; you can just send a `POST` request yourself to that endpoint; (however, you may need to use a `Session` from `requests` to track cookies and headers and such to make sure you have access to that form)"
2310,1558961935.253,Jennette,i will look into this approch
2310,1558961939.2532,Ashley,"going further; if you are trying to test some behavior that happens exclusively on the backend, e.g. calculating tax based on location and cost of the purchase, then you should probably handle that in a unit test without needing any network connection at all"

2317,1559041627.2914,Hiroko,"the depth level in which the copy operation goes; the docs explain it preety well, have you looked there?; <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/copy.html>; &gt;&gt;&gt;The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances):
• A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
• A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don’t exist with shallow copy operations:
• Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop.
• Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as data which is intended to be shared between copies."

I have two different issues with django 2.2.1 combined with Heroku CI:

*one* being that the `DATABASES` in the settings file for some reason is defined recursively. so the `default` value holds a key `TEST`which includes the content of default as well as a key `TEST` (etc). this is mainly a problem as django tries to sanitize the settings file, which hangs indefinitely, upon trying to show a stack trace

the *second* being that the CI throws the following exception when tearing down the test run `django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: (1064, ""You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'CASCADE;\n CREATE SCHEMA public;\n GRANT ALL' at line 1"")`. utilizing JawsDB with (maybe? not sure how to verify) mysql 8.0.

I also asked sunday but got no result. if anyone has a clue as to how to fix it or (even better) how to find the solution myself."
2319,1559045098.3065,Lolita,better define it in the class itself… MyClass(data).to_dict(); Because I guess the conversion logic is specific to the class.
2319,1559045331.3074,Christina,"you could utilize __dict__ (or override it, but that might cause weird behaviour) - but i don't think there is a specific naming convention for that concern. not AFAIK atleast. but i would also say it should be a method on the instance"
2319,1559045470.3076,Lolita,I’m sure Django and Heroku both has active slack or other IRL communities where they are most active. You may find your answers in those channels sooner.; There’s a separate channel for Django even in this comminity; I don’t think we should ever mess with __dict__.; BTW __dict__ is a dict instance not a method. It holds all the state of the object in it.

2319,1559046360.3089,Lolita,"I think you can try redefining the questions better with code examples and ways to reproduce the issue. If you feel it’s a bug, you can create an issue to the respective repos (search for already closed issues before creating one). There will be issue templates guiding you to define the exact problem better so that others don’t have to spend much effort understanding it."

2324,1559066730.322,Sasha,I'm not quite sure what you mean. Are you looking for `(.*?)` to get a minimal-length wildcard?
2324,1559066764.3228,Ashley,or are you looking to reference the first capture group?
2324,1559066767.3229,Jolanda,I'm looking for all between STRING and the first found condition
2324,1559066779.3233,Claudine,just reference your first capture group
2324,1559066798.3236,Ashley,capture groups are determined by parenthesis; that site provides a breakdown of your capture groups on the right

regarding the settings, i am simply utilizing the features of the framework. The recursiveness is not a result of an action i have taken, but rather something done by the django_heroku module. `django_heroku.settings(locals())` which automatically sets the database stuff. i haven't seen the action before, and afaik it only happens in CI.

I could probably deal with a minimal example. i still get the recursive thing. that bug wasn't fixed by changing to postgres.  if i don't get any leads on the heroku support nor stack overflow i'll try an isolated test and the report it to the module and whereever else (or hopefully just solve it on my lonesome); <@Lolita> true! :slightly_smiling_face:"

2333,1559115365.3602,Jimmy,<@Conchita> if you don't know it <http://regex101.com|regex101.com> is pretty cool for testing regex

2333,1559115533.3612,Guillermina,"well, you wanted something ""simple and easy""...
not sure if I should have mentioned `sqlite`, sorry... :wink:; the regex makes sure to have the words within ""word boundaries"" by using `\b`.
So it would match ` cluster ` but not ` clusters `.

`""cluster"" in ""some clusters do things""` would return True though.
If you want to make sure to match the word exactly, you should listify the string by splitting it up at whitespace.
`""cluster"" in [""some"", ""clusters"", ""do"", ""things""]` would return False"

When i use the lib directly `python2.7` -&gt; `import jss; jss_prefs = jss.JSSPrefs(); j = jss.JSS(jss_prefs);` i can use my custom API Call an retrieve xml data `j.Patch()` for example returns xml code which i can work with via ElementTree.
After that i extended JSSImporter which init the ""Connection"" via `self.jss = jss.JSS(**kwargs)`. But this time when i call `self.jss.Patch()` i don't receive xml, instead i get a QuerySet which is not mutable.

- the `reset()` function isnt doing what you think its doing. it will only reset your `self.name` about 1 in a million times
- the if/else block in `create_name` doesnt work. the else will never be reached because self.created_name is always not in self.used_names.
- you might want to put self.used_names in your __init__ method, so that you can keep track of what names have been used"

2354,1559202931.0162,Leida,umm you mean add the before and after after the code is written?; or just add for certain methods; or just nvm... you could just write a decorator that does the before and after; if you can embed the before and after in the class then a decorator does the trick

In Python 3.7 now you can do it this way:

  class ParentClass:
      def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):

it will apply decorator for each subclass of ParentClass```; found that on stackexchange, havent tried it; but thats whole class not method... but i think this could be extended to target fixed methods"

2354,1559205422.0298,Leida,indeed and the super decorates the abstract class - cool; altho i might instead decorate the abstract method implicitly not through init as this calls `ABC.__init_subclass__` which might not be the best

2356,1559214099.0512,Ashley,"<@Eveline> In this case, since your trying to figure out whether or not this object has write access, you could make it a method or property (more or less a method that you don't have to explicitly call, so it just looks fancy), and you could reference that, which would make it more explicit. E.g.

```
if my_thing.has_write_access:
    # do some stuff
```

If the thing you're working with isn't something you control the source of, or it's a complicated class that you don't want to mess with, then you can either abstract it by creating another class that wraps instances of this one (allowing you to provide more clean and logical ways of interacting with it), or you could make another class that inherits from that class and define the method there."

I’m not much familiar with raspberry pi, but if it’s an option, it’s the best one. Although, I don’t think there’s anything hacky in a while loop. In my opinion it’s the best and cleanest loop you could use in this scenario. The daemons are most probably instructions running in a while loop."
2357,1559216523.0582,Arnoldo,i see. thank you <@Lolita>; So it will not stress out the computer to have an endless loop running on the pi like that?; i'm thinking too much like a human i guess :slightly_smiling_face:; i figured a daemon would give it a rest in between queries.

2364,1559234780.1076,Rolando,"Hey quick question; What happens if a i have and operator in an if for example
```if 'collector' not in keys and row['collector']:
``` if the first is false, does it evaluates the next condition ?; or it will jump to the next line because the statement wont be true due to the first condition being False?"
2364,1559234936.1103,Sasha,"The `and` and `or` operators will indeed short-circuit, so the second clause wouldn't be evaluated."
2364,1559234940.1104,Mayra,"The left clause will be evaluated first, and then the right one only if the first one is False"

2364,1559235281.1116,Raguel,and if we put parans around `if 'collector' not in (keys and row['collector']):`?
2364,1559235707.1138,Sasha,"That's a little weird. If `keys` is non-empty, it would check if `'collector'` was in `keys`. If `keys` is empty, it would check if `'collector'` was in `row['collector']`. But it won't check if it's in both, as you might expect from English grammar. (Edit: this is wrong, see below.)"
2364,1559235852.114,Rolando,yes i didnt met not in; ment in; but the real question was about the evaluation if the first one was false
2364,1559236394.115,Raguel,was feeling blank that would be printed so just started checking what gets printed
2364,1559236784.1161,Sasha,"Actually what I said above was for `or` logic, so I got it wrong, oops."
2364,1559237023.1175,Raguel,"so it goes like this that if it is `(True or False)`, it will evaluate to `True` and so on, right?"

['no', 'not', 'nope']
```"
2365,1559250060.1212,Ashley,"<@Brain> that's because it won't work. The `and` operator in this case is leveraging ""truthiness""; basically, `a` is considered ""truthy"", so it moves on to `b`; because `b` is also ""truthy"", the whole statement evaluates to `b`; e.g.; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] and [4,5,6]
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```; it's kind of the opposite of a shortcircuit; if you look at the `or` operator, it has similar logic; but stops at the first ""truthy"" thing and just evaluates to that; e.g.; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] or [4,5,6]
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```; basically, whichever thing in the comparison answers the ""question"" is what the comparison resolves to; for example; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; False and [1,2,3]
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```; ```
&gt;&gt;&gt; [] and [1,2,3]
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```; it really doesn't care about the `[1,2,3]` in the last two examples, because it already knew the answer to the ""question"" after looking at the first thing"
2365,1559250335.1285,Hiroko,"you;d need to do two separate `in` evaluations; you can’t say “hey, for this one thing, I want you to look in two lists at once”"
2365,1559250366.1303,Brain,"well I wouldn’t say this won’t work.
For example, `&gt;&gt;&gt; 'this' in (True and ['this', 'that'])` will work, but I wouldn’t approve such PR :smile:"

2365,1559250372.1306,Ashley,"it works out in an actual `if` statement, because whichever it resolves to will also be evaluated based on its truthiness; <@Brain> the reason that works is because `(True and ['this', 'that'])` evaluates to just `['this', 'that']`; the `True and` is moot"

2365,1559251083.1359,Ashley,There's a list of things that are considered falsey somewhere; Pretty much everything else is considered truthy
2367,1559252683.1367,Raguel,"still not sure why this evaluates to latter here?; and if we do `['this', 'that'] and True`, it evaluates to `True`"
2365,1559255409.1375,Ashley,"Because the first thing didn't fully answer the question. Both have to be truthy, so if the first one was truthy, then the only thing that matters is the 2nd thing; If the 2nd thing is truthy, then that fully answers the question"

2380,1559315085.2275,Conrad,okay but how does that work for this case. I would still have to iterate over 200K parentheses
2380,1559315134.2284,Clemmie,"might be ok, because you aren’t doing a list lookup and comparison each time, just the comparison; and if it is still not fast enough, you look for other efficiencies"
2380,1559315180.2291,Conrad,hmmm; lol and they marked this problem as painless/easy; another optimization I can think of is to return 0 if the length of the string is not even
2380,1559315442.2302,Clemmie,won’t that fail the nested string requirement?
2380,1559315607.231,Sasha,I think a big optimization would be to work from the end of the list instead of inserting and popping at element 0... that causes Python to need to shift every element in the list with every access.
2380,1559315686.2312,Conrad,"how can the string be a proper nested string if the length of the string is not even? for every left parenthesis there has to be a right parenthesis. this check by itself is not sufficient, but it would work as an optimization; so insert at the end and remove at the end?; I had not thought of this; makes sense"
2380,1559315903.2321,Clemmie,"`('a')` is a properly nested string, odd length"

2380,1559316007.2333,Clemmie,unless I misunderstand “S has the form “(U)” or “[U]” or “{U}” where U is a properly nested string;”
2380,1559316189.2339,Conrad,the only characters in the string are parentheses
2380,1559316228.2341,Clemmie,"Ok, I misunderstood that part then"

I installed 3.7 and created a new virtualenv but I was wondering if there is an easy way to upgrade a 3.5 virtualenv to 3.7 or migrate the packages versus installing everything from scratch.  Is this possible?"
2381,1559318846.2384,Hiroko,"well, you should have a requirements file from your previous venv, right?; just create a venv with 3.7, and install the requirements"

For example, when you see something like `from accounts.views import accounts_app`, how do you know if it is:
- A. You are importing a file (i.e. module) `accounts_app.py` from the `accounts/views/` directory?
- B. You are importing a function named `accounts_app` from a `accounts/views.py` file?
- C. You are importing a variable named `accounts_app` from a `accounts/views.py` file?"

2402,1559389500.3247,Jettie,is this homework?
2402,1559389975.3251,Roxie,To whom your asking ?
2402,1559392120.3259,Ashley,<@Roxie> please use code snippets. It does syntax highlighting and makes it easier to read

2402,1559392323.3306,Roxie,This is fine now?
2402,1559392332.3308,Ashley,"Yeah, thanks"
2402,1559392339.3311,Roxie,Yup I can understand
2402,1559392463.3334,Ashley,"<@Lanelle> think about counting. We use base-10 for our number system, which means we have 10 characters to represent different numbers. We start with 0 and increment until we reach 9. What is the next thing we do, now that we've run out of characters? We ""carry the 1"" and start on the next number place with `10`. Notice how we have a 1 in the tens place and a 0 in the ones place. This is because we have 1 ten and 0 ones. We started over with the ones and looped back around to zero; Binary works the same way. It's just a base-2 system, so there's only 2 number characters, and the number places are exponents of 2 instead of 10 (e.g. the ones place, the twos place, the fours place); If I wanted all the permutations of base-10 numbers that go up to 999, I would just start counting at 000; The trick is that the characters I use to represent the numbers doesn't actually matter, so long as they're consistent; <@Roxie> so it looks like you're trying to scrape YouTube comments. Selenium is actually a very bad scraping tool. It's an abstraction around the WebDriver protocol, which is meant for automated testing that simulates user behavior.  YouTube actually has an API that you can make web requests to directly to get comments and comment threads from a video. I highly recommend you use that instead"
2402,1559395042.3421,Roxie,<@Ashley> Yeah I tried API also I'm not sure about where the replies lies. I have scraped the comments with API. Will share the snippet now

2403,1559400029.3469,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt; The replies object is a container that contains a list of replies to the comment, if any exist. The replies.comments property represents the list of comments itself."

2406,1559403852.3487,Eugenio,can poetry ensure i have the correct python version?; or is it only for package versions?
2406,1559403923.349,Chester,"You have to specify the supported python versions range (or a specific one), and it won’t install on an unsupported python"
2406,1559403961.3492,Eugenio,"so it wont handle installing one, but you can define the version as a dependency?"
2406,1559403983.3494,Chester,"Oh, it won’t install pythons for you; `pyenv` does the job though"
2406,1559404036.3498,Eugenio,im on windows and just looking to make sure if someone downloads something i did in python they can install the packages and ensure they have the correct python version; so i guess a combination of poetry and pyenv is all i need?
2406,1559404080.3502,Chester,pyenv doesn’t work on windows afaik; but it’s not really needed because the system does not depend on any particular python version; you can install multiple pythons from nuget/chocolatey/python.org site without a hassle
2406,1559404168.3508,Eugenio,"how do you manage which python is ""active"" though?"
2406,1559404228.3512,Chester,"In windows, you have to be explicit. There’s also `py.exe` wrapper that allows you to select the desired version ad hoc; I’m not sure if poetry works on windows, but you can check easily"
2406,1559404250.3516,Eugenio,"oh; the command runs at least, i was just about to try it out; ""Poetry requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+. It is multi-platform and the goal is to make it work equally well on Windows, Linux and OSX."""
2406,1559404462.3522,Chester,Ok great
2406,1559404661.3524,Jimmy,on windows you might want to install python from the store; it's probably a lot easier

2406,1559405560.3532,Eugenio,"ah nice, didnt know about that; actually if you try to run python from the commandline, if its not available it'll automatically open up the store page for python"

2406,1559413154.3564,Raven,"Right, so you can see that you've repeated something... so factor that out to a variable; You can look at each part of the code, see where you've 'hard-coded' something, and refactor it to be based on the input instead"

2406,1559413495.3595,Raven,"You want to iterate over all the possible 'digits', for all the possible 'positions'. There are 7 positions in 'evening', and 7 digits (if you allow duplicates). So you can go from there"

2406,1559413952.361,Raven,Sadly not. This isn't the sort of thing most people will code themselves when there are tools for it in the standard library

2424,1559542198.4144,Leora,Anyone have any good places or processes to learn about decorators? I get the high level concept and have used @x.setter. Looking for resources/best practices on good place to start using them.
2424,1559542335.4146,Mildred,"im in the same boat.

I kinda get the idea, but no firm grasp of really when to use them (except flask, i get it for routes)"
2424,1559542615.4148,Chester,"<https://www.google.com/search?q=python+decorators>
&gt; About 3,130,000 results"
2424,1559543267.4153,Leora,<@Chester>: I've done that and will continue to do that. This was a question for people who may have been in a similar position and see if they had a preferred place to go look. Good to know Google is always a backup though.
2424,1559543394.4155,Chester,"My point is that there are literally millions of articles and books about python in general, and decorators in specific. They are roughly the same because they describe the same concept.
They differ only in wording, and you can pick your favorite one just by looking at the first google search results page."
2425,1559545392.4159,Conchita,"I think its 100% fair to ask for recommend sources on a specific topic; With ""millions of resources"" a lot of it will be mediocre"
2425,1559545543.4163,Chester,"What about trying to read something, literally anything, first, then ask to clarify if the article is not clear?
This is highly subjective, and doesn’t differ much from asking to write some code for them."
2425,1559545557.4165,Conchita,"<@Leora> I'm also in your same position reg decorators, so can't vouch for these specifically but every time I watch a Corey Schafer on a complex topic I feel I get the basics; <https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/search?query=decorator>"
2426,1559551546.4175,Viviana,Yes can you explain what data you want to multiply row or column or full csv file ??
2425,1559552201.4188,Rikki,"<@Leora> <https://github.com/dkraczkowski/opyapi> I am building my library on decorators maybe source code can help you a bit <https://github.com/dkraczkowski/opyapi>, check `annotations` section and `examples` for example usage"

In this case, it opens the file, and closes it again when you leave. The `as csvfile` is providing you with a variable name that you can reference the file with. You can put anything you want there.

I recently was messing around (dumb) with my Python versions with brew, pip, and other tools.
I installed Python 3.7.3 and tried making it my standard Python version (running on MacOS 10.14.5).
Now everytime I run a python script, it hangs and I am forced to cancel out (ctrl+c) and I get these lines of code at the end.

2432,1559575770.0068,Deana,I’m using brew as my package manager
2432,1559575774.007,Ashley,awesome; so you installed python 3 with brew?

/usr/local/bin/python3```"
2432,1559575829.008,Ashley,"hmm; ok, so that should all be good; so as long as you reference that when you make a virtual env, you should be fine; when the virtual env is active, just make sure you ahve all the resources you need through pip"
2432,1559575908.0094,Deana,maybe i need to recreate my virtualenv
2432,1559575915.0096,Ashley,that can help sometimes; just make sure that nothing is installed at the system level
2432,1559575955.0106,Deana,yea i think thats what the issue is. perhaps I should purge any instance of python3 and then activate virtualenv and install python3 again in the virtualenv?; leave python2.7 as the only version of python on the system level?

2432,1559576022.0121,Ashley,"however, some stuff may have gotten installed at the system level that shouldn't have; try running `python3 -m pip freeze`; (without the virtualenv); and then `python2 -m pip freeze`; these will show you what packages were installed through pip at the system level"

Is it okay to declare multiple nested sessions?

For example if you have a main async method.

```loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())```

inside this main function your are doing multiple async requests and maybe inside one of those you’re going another async request. Is it possible to redeclare that session, or do i need to pass is down the chain?"

2443,1559657884.0294,Roxie,<@Christina> Yup that is not a feature from API; <@Ashley> I applied a condition like if the comment count is 0 assume that comments are disabled; Is that right way to follow

Whether your solution is sufficient, depends on the problem you are trying to solve.

2446,1559662100.0401,Christina,"but this is deducible from the exception. Python is all about `ask for forgiveness rather than permission` - afaik python is optimized regarding exceptions that you can essentially use them as flags to parse around. but your solution is fine but i would probably add the exception that can be cast by `influx`. This except would also get caught if for instance the system tries to shut down the program gracefully, meaning the program wont shut down but rather tell your system that the db write failed."

2446,1559662547.046,Ashley,"<@Adolfo> I'd guess that you have some flow control where you call that function based on the return value. I might try handling the exception there instead in that function. That way there isn't redundant flow control and it's explicitely stated what's happening at that level and isn't  something like:

```
if self.do_thing():

else:

i have created a recursive function that kind of works, however at the moment it only returns the value for last iteration. what i want is that all values from all iterations to be stored and returned as a list. I tried adding list but then i get error message below.
this works but with not list:

2461,1559748971.1259,Catherina,"Hey guys, quick question.

How would one go about setting up a “production” server for python development?

I mean, how do you avoid problems with different python versions, different libraries, etc

when e.g jenkins build your code on the prod server, how do you make it available to everyone on that server without any library conflicts?; under which path would these packages be installed to be able to be accessed by everyone?"
2461,1559749040.1269,Clemmie,"docker, vm, pyenv - various answers for somewhat different use cases"
2461,1559749119.1278,Carlo,"yep, asking how a deployment should be done will get you _many_ different answers depending on specific usecases"
2461,1559749191.1289,Clemmie,"it also scares me that you are thinking about something being accessible by everyone on a _production_ server. Things should be accessible to _no one_ - only the services provided (db, webserver, etc) should be accessible for their use case"
2461,1559749248.1293,Catherina,"What I mean is if I write a python app, it should be able to be executed by anyone"
2462,1559750275.131,Carmen,"The use-case you're talking about is unclear, so we're a bit leery about just giving you an answer and sending you on your way without knowing more of what you're aiming for and why you think everyone needs to execute something your Jenkins server is building.; For that matter, a Jenkins server shouldn't be building things on a server you're using for active development. It should be building it, storing the artifacts somewhere, and then you pull those artifacts for a deployment to your dev/prod machines."
2462,1559750965.133,Catherina,"I just want to essentially develop stuff -&gt; create a git PR -&gt; have jenkins do some testing -&gt; if all good push the code to a “prod” server, where the end-user can use the app.; My main question here is how do I avoid conflicting libraries etc if I install multiple apps on the same prod server?"
2462,1559751024.135,Nenita,<@Ashley> sorry for the late reply. im going to skip this for now because the person who will be using this will have to remote in anyways because of two purchased programs that are needed for pulling qb data and importing it.
2462,1559751026.1351,Catherina,"I know about virtual environments, but the user will definetly not know about activating Ves before running scripts etc"
2463,1559752070.1362,Ashley,<@Nenita> gotcha
2462,1559752147.1369,Ashley,"<@Catherina> there is a difference between writing a library, and providing a service; if you are providing a service, then you don't care what environment others have. You control the environment it runs in; if you are writing a library, then you can test against multiple python versions you want to support, but it's up to those who want to use it to make sure they're using a supported python version; python isn't really built for making standalone apps; it's possible to do this, but not advised, and usually requires you bundling the environment (i.e. python executable, along with the necessary libraries) with it; if you're making a library, you can have your CI pipeline build a virtual env for each python version you want to support, and then run the tests inside it; if you're making a service, then each ""app"" should be a separate service, ideally running on one or more machines that are dedicated to only running that service; that way there is no conflicts; if, for some reason, you need to run it all on the same machine, then either use virtual environments for each ""app"", or containerize them with docker so that each app gets its own container with its own environment; if you think that everything needs to be in the same environment, but could somehow still have conflicts, then you have some hyper-coupled systems that you need to break apart anyway, which renders the need for a singular environment moot; personally, I recommend docker instead of virtual envs, because that scales up much better and is easier to manage; virtual envs are better for local development though, because they take much less time to set up; having said that, many people just develop in the containers themselves; i.e. they write the code locally, and then use their normal docker file to make a container whenever they want to run the code or run tests against it"
2462,1559754536.1467,Catherina,hey <@Ashley> thanks for the write-up
2464,1559754562.1473,Catherina,"My intent is not that “complex” to be honest. We are not software developers, but network engineers trying to write scripts; If we go the virtual environments route, how exactly would someone sshing into a box know to, for example, enable the virtual environment before using that particular script?; also how do you automatically put it in the user’s path so he can just call the script without knowing the full path?"

2464,1559754857.1507,Clemmie,This might get you a little closer; sorry about the formatting; you can see here in the docs that client can actually take a fairly large number of kwargs <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html#boto3.session.Session.client>

2465,1559757942.1548,Ashley,"<@Catherina> what will these ""scripts"" be doing?"

2465,1559757998.1561,Ashley,"I'm finding it odd that someone would SSH into a box just to run a script, let alone SSH into a box to run a script that SSH's into a box to run scripts; that sounds like a recipe for disaster; what is the desired behavior?; there may already be something that does what you want so you don't have to re-invent the wheel; for example, I could SSH into a box for the purpose of setting up a tunnel to another system and spinning up a privately hosted service there so that I run a test suite against it in an isolated environment; or I could just use a proper CI/CD pipeline"
2465,1559758500.1595,Catherina,"well these are simple python scripts; Example: <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm>; NAPALM allows you to interact with network devices to do jinja2-based configurations (as an example); My concern is what happens when I need both app X and Y, yet they have different library dependencies; e.g on needs lxml&gt;=1 and the other lxml&lt;=0.2; How do you handle the conflict?"
2465,1559758629.1624,Clemmie,if there are dependencies on anything besides the standard lib they are not simple scripts
2465,1559758630.1625,Jesusa,V I already answered your question; None; the answer is virtualenvironments and everyone will tell you the same thing
2465,1559758727.1643,Clemmie,"if you need to insulate your users from the virtual environment stuff, then you need to provide these tool as a service, not “log onto the machine via ssh and run”"

2465,1559758861.1701,Jesusa,None; I guarantee you there is no easier way of doing this
2465,1559758892.1719,Clemmie,that is a fine answer and I agree with that
2465,1559758915.1729,Romaine,"we have tooling where I work written completely in Python that installs via brew or apt that creates a virtual env, but doesn't require the user to have any idea that it uses virtual env or even Python"
2465,1559758972.1747,Carlo,"just creating aliases or wrapper scripts to run the script with python within the virtual environment, put in $PATH would work too"
2465,1559759023.1767,Clemmie,"ultimately <@Catherina> you have your answer here, in many forms. None of it might be what you want to hear, but all correct and complete"
2465,1559759050.1775,Romaine,"mind you, the tooling is also for network security at the hosting provider I work at, and the majority of the scripts its made of was written almost entirely by Network Security Engineers writing Python"
2465,1559759099.1787,Clemmie,Agreed. my biggest sticking point on this whole thing is the requirement that Network Engineers not need to understand how to spin up and run a venv; I would be hiring a new network team if that excuse was given
2465,1559759138.1803,Catherina,&gt; who want to be insulated from the need to do anything besides `$ run_script`
2465,1559759143.1807,Ashley,network engineers should be able to handle that pretty easily
2465,1559759143.1808,Catherina,essentially this ^
2465,1559759168.182,Romaine,"yup! not every Network Engineer wants to learn code, but I am an incredible advocate for the ability to code to be a major part of a Network Engineers profile"
2465,1559759169.1821,Ashley,<@Catherina> then you should make a service that they send requests to
2465,1559759188.183,Clemmie,^ if they can’t be trusted to run python correctly
2465,1559759201.1835,Ashley,"actually, network engineers still need to learn scripting and understand shell environments very well in order to do their job"
2465,1559759216.1839,Romaine,not always <@Ashley>
2465,1559759227.1846,Catherina,"Anyway I see what you guys mean. Now it’s just a matter of figuring out how to apply this. I’ve worked in Amazon where we had these boxes were all our tools would get deployed to, everything would be in your path once you ssh into the box."
2465,1559759230.1848,Romaine,but the most successful Network Engineers should know code
2465,1559759235.185,Catherina,"With no knowledge of virtual envs etc; just want to replicate that, but unsure how they set it up"
2465,1559759288.1866,Ashley,"if they're newbies, I would not expect them to have that level of knowledge, but virtual environments literally just manipulate the $PATH variable, and if they didn't understand how that worked, that would raise several red flags"
2465,1559759293.1868,Jesusa,they probably did exactly what I told you to do; virtualenvs do not just manipulate $PATH; there’s a ton of stuff going on
2465,1559759344.1882,Ashley,"kind of. they make a duplicate install of python, and then manipulate the $PATH to point to that install"
2465,1559759349.1884,Clemmie,"as a shorthand, yes that is what they do"
2465,1559759364.1888,Ashley,"technically, it doesn't even have to be an install of python"
2465,1559759385.1896,Catherina,thanks <@Jesusa>; and others; I’ll try to figure out how to make this work in practice
2465,1559759403.1903,Ashley,"it's just an alternate bin, include, and lib folder"
2465,1559759423.1907,Jesusa,"symlinks, not copies"
2465,1559759461.1913,Ashley,"nah, it's a copy"
2465,1559759469.1916,Clemmie,I’ve never heard of it being a symlink; it is a copy
2465,1559759487.1924,Ashley,"there's symlinks in there, but they just point back to the copy of python; i.e.; ```

2465,1559759564.1941,Romaine,"we have CCIEs where I work that do not know code, and it makes me lose respect for them, even with the power that cert holds"
2465,1559759618.1956,Catherina,CCIE != coding
2465,1559759620.1957,Romaine,"at that point in a Network Engineers career, they should be talking about forward progress, and networks configured mostly by hand in any scope is a liability"
2465,1559759636.1961,Catherina,I am a CCIE but coding is different.
2465,1559759675.1973,Ashley,that blows my mind; <@Catherina> do you know how the `$PATH` variable works?

2465,1559759738.1992,Romaine,"congrats on that, and I respect you immensely for that cert, but if you are not doing anything to further the future of Network Engineering, then all I can say is that you would be worth even more with more knowledge in Code/Automation"
2465,1559759754.1998,Ashley,I would be amazed if you didn't
2465,1559759757.2,Romaine,me too
2465,1559759771.2007,Jesusa,None
2465,1559759774.2012,Romaine,"but like I said, I know a few CCIE who don't and don't think its important at all"
2465,1559759776.2013,Jesusa,"default symlinks unless `nt`; looks like the primary interpreter is a copy though, depends on the version however"
2465,1559759930.2036,Ashley,"I'm not saying you need to know python to be CCIE, but you should know how to write a script, and understand the shell well enough to know how $PATH works; you'd have to go to some extreme lengths to avoid that information when getting the CCIE cert"
2465,1559760024.2043,Romaine,agreed
2465,1559760146.2056,Catherina,"Oh, of course :thumbsup:"
2465,1559760148.2059,Clemmie,"<@Jesusa> where did you find that code?; Not arguing, just interested"
2465,1559760160.2065,Jesusa,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>
2465,1559760161.2066,Catherina,What I’m talking about here is how to setup a dev/qa/prod environment
2465,1559760163.2069,Jesusa,the official package
2465,1559760176.2072,Catherina,something I never had to do in Amazon because it was all already there; :cold_sweat:
2465,1559760193.2079,Jesusa,they’re hinting symlinks should be the default
2465,1559760215.2088,Ashley,<@Jesusa> that just suggests that `nt` is the primary exception; not the default; ah sorry I misread
2465,1559760297.2106,Jesusa,symlinks on mine; None
2465,1559760299.2111,Clemmie,Interesting. Historically (pre-venv) it was not. I don’t feel strongly one way or another. Also that flag help is atrocious “use symlinks if this wouldn’t by default. Where would it by default? who knows!”; I’m torn on the idea
2465,1559760332.2118,Jesusa,I don’t care either way; :slightly_smiling_face:; happy to hlep
2465,1559760338.2125,Clemmie,"faster setup, sure; dirties up /usr/local though; eh, I use containers, so it doesn’t matter"
2465,1559760413.2133,Ashley,oh wait; we're reading it backwards; ah nevermind; I think I've read it assbackwards
2465,1559760470.2147,Clemmie,"venv will default to symlinks for the main python interpreter, unless it is on `nt`, unless you use the `--use-symlinks` flag"
2465,1559760482.2152,Ashley,yeah; one sec
2465,1559760485.2155,Clemmie,so that flag is (current;y) only meaningful on nt
2465,1559760489.2157,Ashley,trying with pure venv
2465,1559760496.216,Clemmie,that is pure venv; virtualenv is different
2465,1559760593.2165,Ashley,"yeah; the one I pulled from earlier was made with something else; so I wanted to try again with the pure venv; and I stand corrected; but yeah, that irks me; the point of the venv is to avoid conflicts with the system level install as well as other installs; upgrading the system level install could break the venv; <@Jesusa> :taco:; what's up with `nt` though?"
2465,1559760849.2193,Hiroko,"windows, I think; specifically windows NT versions; comes from this:  <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/sysmodule.c#L1957-L1982>; either `posix` or `nt`; <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/os.py#L6>"
2466,1559761303.2212,Carmon,what up
2465,1559761510.2217,Jesusa,<@Ashley> How is a copy of an interpreter different from a symlink?
2465,1559761567.222,Holly,symlink goes to the location you have it pointed to
2466,1559761576.2224,Holly,a copy is an instance in and of itself separate from the other
2466,1559761585.2227,Clemmie,if you change what is at the linked location - :fireworks:
2465,1559761608.2233,Clemmie,"for tooling that have to have know, pinned versions, that is not great"
2466,1559761614.2236,Jesusa,"nothing should change the system python, ever; this is by design; otherwise bad things start to happen in *NIX land"
2466,1559761642.2245,Clemmie,no system has 3.7 as the default yet; so you are linkeng to an installed 3.7; which could be fine. But maybe there is a 3.7.1 bug fix - most would install it where 3.7 is. but that might break a contract with the app that is using 3.7
2465,1559761702.2266,Jesusa,that’s the equivalent of saying “you shouldn’t symlink openssh” because anyone should be able to swap the binary in /usr/bin
2466,1559761704.2268,Hiroko,"also, yesterday, Apple stated they were removing system python by default in futhre releases of OSX"
2465,1559761722.2273,Jesusa,but they’re keeping ruby? <@Hiroko>
2466,1559761726.2277,Hiroko,:nope:
2466,1559761730.2278,Clemmie,nope - removing all scripting languages
2465,1559761739.228,Hiroko,"<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_10_15_beta_release_notes>; &gt;&gt;&gt;• Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include scripting language runtimes by default, and might require you to install additional packages. If your software depends on scripting languages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app. (49764202)

• Use of Python 2.7 isn’t recommended as this version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include Python 2.7. Instead, it’s recommended that you run python3 from within Terminal. (51097165)"
2465,1559761802.2301,Clemmie,"if I had a contract/regulation, say in healthcare, where all versions needed to be pinned and had catastrophic regulatory penalties if it changed without approval, you would be sure I am copying and not symlinking openssh too"
2465,1559761844.2316,Jesusa,"If I had a contract/regulation I would ensure the binaries have only executable permissions, and that’s it"
2466,1559761848.2318,Clemmie,that is why we use docker with versy specific release version identifications
2466,1559761873.2324,Jesusa,docker is not invulnenable to this
2466,1559761881.2327,Clemmie,not invulnerable no
2467,1559761884.2331,Mariah,"Hi folks, have question regarding polling best practices. I have a Python/flask app that needs to request data from an external server (for example: Instagram). The intention is to check it regularly for changes. I was thinking of just making a simple beautifulsoup scraper, logging the most recent post and comparing the new one to the saved one in the DB. This comparison request -&gt; compare script would be executed by a cronjob say every 1 second. Is there a better approach?"
2466,1559761888.2333,Clemmie,layered approach
2465,1559761921.2337,Clemmie,<@Mariah> I would look to see if the external app had an api to use
2467,1559761969.2339,Mariah,"Hi, the resource isnt what im worried about, its the polling approach."
2466,1559762058.2349,Clemmie,"What I am saying is that a scraper to parse the html and then compare the widget every second is a little heavy. If there was an api where you could pull the last_changed of a widget, you could poll that; If you get into running a lot of these, every second, you will end up with a backed up queue"
2466,1559762101.2358,Jesusa,"why do you need to parse the html? just check the site’s checksum before parsing; I ran the scraper fleet for <http://quandl.com|quandl.com> this works nicely; in fact, there’s a specific http request to get the checksum"
2466,1559762190.2371,Mariah,how do i get the checksum?
2466,1559762200.2373,Jesusa,I did this a long time ago
2466,1559762202.2375,Mariah,I agree. A webhook would be ideal but not all platforms have this
2466,1559762220.2377,Jesusa,`HEAD` will work; if they’re fully REST compliant; you might be able to just get the Last-Modified field
2466,1559762248.2383,Clemmie,"absolutely. your polling idea has a good core, I would just be aware of the cases where it might break sown"
2466,1559762263.2388,Jesusa,else just `hash()` the request content
2468,1559762269.2391,Catherina,"Hey guys, anyone knows how to do this <https://stackoverflow.com/a/23069201/9456478>"
2466,1559762275.2394,Catherina,but in a more robust way?
2466,1559762300.2401,Jesusa,<@Catherina> you could just alias `python` to something else; but this is all super fragile; hash is super fast and is probably more reliable than that.
2466,1559762421.2416,Ashley,"sorry, I meant why did it get special treatment"
2466,1559762492.2431,Clemmie,"<@Catherina> you would be better off writing a quick howto document for your scripts - spin up the env, run. If they depend on a python package that is not in the standard python install you can even catch the `ImportError` and print the venv startup help text"
2466,1559762604.2444,Catherina,"Yeah but I want people to just be able to ssh into box -&gt; have all scripts in user’s $PATh; clearly explicitly setting the venv python’s path in the python script is… well, not optimal; but not sure what are better alternatives"
2466,1559762743.2453,Ashley,"<@Catherina> I agree with <@Clemmie>. if they are SSH'ing into the box and calling the script, then they can read the `README`."
2465,1559762782.2457,Ashley,"or, just make it a service for the to query directly"
2466,1559762829.2467,Clemmie,we’re having a little trouble helping because you are really forcing a square peg into a round hole
2466,1559762837.247,Catherina,ok… but the readme-route how does that fit into the dev/qa/prod setup? At that point there’d be no need for a “prod” server; each user would just build his own; via the readme
2465,1559762876.2488,Catherina,what I wanted was for something centralized
2466,1559762897.2497,Arcelia,"Anyone familiar with the pywin32 wrapper? I am having a bit of a challenge with FindWindow, definitely sure I have the right title, found it using EnumWindows"
2466,1559762901.2499,Clemmie,"depends - if these access other, more locked down machines for networking then I would have an ip whitelist on the other machines, only accessible from your control machine"
2466,1559764300.2525,Jesusa,I would just have a jumpbox with a firewall or ingress rules
2465,1559765373.2612,Carmen,"<@Catherina> If you're dead set on this particular implementation path, I would recommend that you have your Jenkins server package up the virtualenv along with the script so that it's all one artifact. Then you deploy that artifact to your servers, along with a wrapper script that activates the virtualenv and runs the actual script. Drop a symlink to that wrapper script in `/usr/bin` and make it executable by the users who should be allowed to run it.; That keeps your dependencies contained within the virtualenv, and your users are insulated from anything related to the virtualenv because they're just calling the wrapper script."
2469,1559767222.2631,Jesusa,that’s… a lot of work; for a network guy; if people are going to do `python /path/to/my/script` you could just alias python to activate the virtualenv ahead of time
2469,1559767803.2657,Letty,"<@Catherina> If you make your scripts part of a python package and install them into a virtualenv, then they’ll show up inside that virtualenv’s bin directory. You can then symlink those files from anywhere (/usr/bin etc) and they’ll run inside the virtualenv. <https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html>; (which is roughly the “wrapper script” idea, but the wrapper part itself is handled by virtualenv)"
2469,1559767937.2664,Catherina,:thinking_face:
2469,1559768087.2674,Letty,"This is maybe surprising behavior, but it is documented:
&gt; However, all scripts installed in a virtual environment should be runnable without activating it, and run with the virtual environment’s Python automatically.
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>"
2469,1559768299.2683,Catherina,So <@Letty> how is this more robust than adding the venv’s python path in my `#!`?; For every script; Is it actually better?
2469,1559768852.2708,Layla,"I have a command line python module. If I send a ctrl+c event  then I need to reset terminal. If I let it finish I don't need to reset terminal.

I can input commands, but they just don't appear on the command line. I think I've traced the issue to be caused by:   `proc = Popen(commands, stdout=PIPE)`"
2470,1559769512.2714,Layla,"I think what's happening is I'm piping the stdout, and catching a signal at this point doesn't allow me to stop piping out."
2469,1559770875.2715,Letty,"It’s effectively doing the same thing, but with the advantage that the `venv` module itself is building the wrapper. There’s a decent chance your way of adding the venv’s python to your `#!` line has a subtle bug with environments, while the using the stdlib’s version is more likely to get it correct (and maintain the it moving forward).

Not a huge plus, but it’s always good to use something directly supported instead of rolling your own."
2471,1559778757.2731,Bethany,"Is the signal in the python code?; Can you capture the stdout then print in Python, and use your logic there?"
2470,1559779665.2758,Layla,"I think my problem is I'm capturing the stdout while using GDB, and when the signal is caught by the process I'm always at `proc.wait()` so the stdout is still being sent to a pipe"
2471,1559780653.2763,Bethany,Oh so the subrocess is the one that receives the signal?
2472,1559780925.2765,Shirley,"hey all - hoping to get some help with a django/celery/mysql issue:
I have a django api miner that runs through celery to queue and run the jobs, in which I use django-celery-results with to check the status of jobs; this whole setup is running in docker linux containers.
When a job returns a larger data set, I keep getting a `mysql has gone away` error: <https://bpaste.net/show/cc6cb279f629>
I tried adjusting the batch size per the django docs to create limited amount of records at a time, but that seems to have no effect.
I tried using a `django.db.close_old_connections()` on each time the job stores data, but that also did not have any effect.
my celery settings are: <https://bpaste.net/show/724d1cc516e8>

any idea what may be causing this issue?"
2472,1559781169.2777,Hiroko,Usually this is because you’re operating on the same db connection that you established at the start of the task 
2472,1559781382.2794,Shirley,"the `get` and `store` methods are part of the same class, however the store method which touches the models, is not called until after the `get` method has returned results.; (just verified) the class is re-initialized with each job call; so in theory the store method should be closing it's connection?"
2472,1559781525.2816,Hiroko,Not if you’re using the same queryset 
2472,1559781630.282,Shirley,so django would be keeping it open in anticipation of additional calls?
2472,1559781678.2827,Hiroko,What’s your code?
2472,1559781712.2832,Shirley,"<https://bpaste.net/show/a37ab4693ab8>; that is the full class; then I just call on it with different `view_ids`, re-initializing the class on each call; the celery task that calls on the class: <https://bpaste.net/show/f5e2f708d1a7>"
2472,1559782036.2844,Hiroko,Ok...; `results = ga.get(request=self.request)`; I assume this returns a Django queryset?; Or something from `values`?
2472,1559782129.2865,Shirley,"that is just a call to a method that executes the API call using the Google Analytics python lib <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/rest/>; it creates an authentication using secret key from a json file, makes the http call and returns the results; it doesn't touch any django models at all"
2472,1559782213.2881,Hiroko,"Gotcha ; <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-CONN_MAX_AGE>; Do you have a setting for that?; Non-zero, I mean"
2472,1559782279.2897,Shirley,I did not; just set it to `None` now and will give it a try
2472,1559782316.2906,Hiroko,Ok.  What’s the bulk create batch size?
2472,1559782328.2908,Shirley,100; I tried setting it to 10 and got the same results before
2472,1559782412.2914,Hiroko, <https://github.com/celery/django-celery-results/issues/58>; This might be related to your issue 
2472,1559782704.2925,Shirley,"`""CONN_MAX_AGE"": None,` in the database settings still throws the error :disappointed:; reading up on that bug, am I missing something or was it closed without any fixes?"
2472,1559783090.2944,Hiroko,"Not sure, but does seem related?; Oh, what’s your max_allowed_packet configuration in MySQL?"
2472,1559783126.2958,Shirley,I did not have any explicit setting for mysql
2472,1559783137.2962,Hiroko,"If you’re pushing over the size, MySQL will hang up"
2472,1559783155.2964,Shirley,"wouldn't the batch size negate that?; the responses are fairly small; which translated into django model form, would be even smaller"
2472,1559783307.2982,Hiroko,"Dang... yeah. You’re right ; ```rcds_created += models.GeoNetwork.objects.bulk_create(
                    batch, DB_BATCH_SIZE
                )```; I wonder what would happen if the rcds_created variable was removed, leaving just the bulk create?"
2472,1559783607.3011,Shirley,"will try it now; no go :disappointed:; it seems like it fails around the 3rd time it calls the class; (I have a few `view_ids` it iterates over to perform the jobs); <@Hiroko> so I ended up splitting up my initial jobs (which were pulling YTD) into monthly jobs and they all ran fine, since each job ran relatively quickly using only 1 month of data.
At this point I def think this is a bug of django-celery-task, as somewhere it is keeping connections open for too long, which is causing the failure.
I will try to open a bug on their repo to see what they can find.

Appreciate all your help in troubleshooting it!; <@Hiroko> figured out what the issue was.
I changed the mysql max_packet_size to 256mb and the issue went away, when is when I discovered that my silent exception handler had some code from debugging, which was dumping the full data set into the log, which celery-results was trying to pass into mysql in one go."

2475,1559814549.3137,Guillermina,what's `item` - can it be sorted with sort? maybe you need to give sort more info e.g. using `self.slots.sort(key=some_function_to_sort_by)`
2475,1559814584.3139,Javier,Item is just something that gets appended to self.slots. I'm not sorting item here right?

2478,1559832712.3443,Bao,I wanted to fail. python code works fine and it throws error as expected but jenkins job keep continuing without failing
2478,1559832726.3446,Carlo,"`sys.exit` should be a function call (`sys.exit()`), also it defaults to exit code `0`, which means successful execution by your shell"

b.x = 125
a.f()
b.f()```"

2483,1559845409.4026,Emelda,My powershell brain thinks about everything as an object
2483,1559845420.4028,Hiroko,python is similar
2483,1559845458.4035,Emelda,I've been able to use some of the same stuff in python like using `[0]` on a string to get the first letter; like it's an array
2483,1559845468.4039,Clemmie,"because it is; well, a list"
2483,1559845485.4045,Emelda,so a string is a list of chars

2483,1559846148.4147,Emelda,It's taking everything in me to not get mad and fall on posh 6; But I want to be able to have more flexibility cross-platform and python has that; Or seems to anyway
2483,1559846246.4157,Pura,apparently you can chain tasks; <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/canvas.html#chains>
2483,1559846408.4168,Emelda,One thing I wish I could do was just create Python desktop apps in visual studio with the same drag and drop controls I'd use in c#; there's iron python and all sorts of other things but they look ugly
2483,1559846454.4177,Javier,I didn't know super did that
2483,1559846462.4179,Emelda,tkinter looks like ass
2483,1559846502.4183,Holly,tbh whenever I want to have a visual gui I just run it as a webapp
2485,1559846641.4187,Holly,its easier to deal with in my opinion
2485,1559846647.419,Emelda,Where is the documentation on that?
2483,1559846648.4191,Holly,but I also hate making GUIs lol; I use flask personally since its a really really simple web framework if you want it to be; <http://flask.pocoo.org/>; you'd also have to learn a little bit of html (I pretty much only use html because my interfaces aren't customer facing)
2483,1559846715.4206,Clemmie,"yeah, the two biggies are flask and django"
2483,1559846720.4209,Holly,I'm sure others have different thoughts on interfaces; GUIs rather
2483,1559846738.4215,Clemmie,"different philosophies, but you build web apps in either"
2483,1559846817.4225,Holly,"yup; I personally liked flask for my use case, because its a lot more freeform, and building a project if its really small is a lot easier to get going.  Django is powerful but to me it felt overwhelming with how many pre-populated files and configurations it has from the start"
2483,1559846862.423,Romaine,I like to think that Django is more scalable from the start because of that reason
2486,1559846902.4239,Romaine,"if your project isn't going to grow, why not Flask? :smile:? But hey, if you really love Flask and its going to get bigger, maybe you want to go that route"
2483,1559846929.4245,Romaine,"Django just makes it easier to keep going and keep getting bigger because its built to do so from the start; and while I tend to prefer Django, I might be a bit biased, and personally, its pretty straight forward"
2483,1559847075.4265,Clemmie,"and while is shouldn’t be a deciding factor, the membership of our <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel is about twice the size of the <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel (but they are both in the thousands, so plenty of help in both)"
2483,1559847150.4269,Romaine,"lol, true dat"
2483,1559847192.4277,Pura,"I pefer aiohttp server for web server now over flask because its asynchronous. If im building a webapp i usually make backend api with a static frontend (react, angular) that makes http requests to the api."
2483,1559847218.4282,Holly,"I wanted to go that route Kay, but tbh my javascript skills are pitiful and I really hate trying to learn it lol"
2483,1559847462.4298,Pura,"<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/design/>; ` However Flask is just not designed for large applications or asynchronous servers`; I agree django is to overwhelming so i never used it.

This is why i moved from flask to aiohttp."
2483,1559847514.4307,Hiroko,"<@Pura> quart is flask + aiohttp; I was considering it for an asyncio service at work to operate as an api composition layer application, and decided to go full in on aiohttp instead; but don’t discount sync frameworks just because async is the new hotness; they can still easily handle tens of thousands of requests/minute"
2483,1559848244.4329,Ashley,"that's it's only use; it's basically ""do the stuff from the class above me in the MRO chain"""
2487,1559849008.4337,Javier,Can someone help me figure out why python can't find my python files?; I have 4 files in the same folder and python can't find them; nvm
2488,1559850809.435,Romaine,`__init__.py` missing?
2488,1559852107.4353,Bart,"I need to know build script to publish package in pypi

what is a build script; and where can i find it?"
2488,1559852603.4373,Freeda,"Anyone know of a library that would help me do the following: display a .png image as a window, when clicked a sound goes off, can be closed out via right click; I'm thinking AHK would be easier to use but I want to try it in python since I'm still learning; I found playsound will help with the mp3s but can't figure out what would show a png as a window and trigger on-click"
2488,1559852772.4388,Clemmie,<@Bart> everything for packaging a python project for pypi is here <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/>
2488,1559853110.439,Bart,thanks
2488,1559857069.4398,Sasha,<@Freeda> You might look at PyGame... as I recall it's pretty easy to get basic stuff like that going.
2488,1559859763.4406,Freeda,"Came across that recently while searching, seems like it would be the best choice. Thanks"
